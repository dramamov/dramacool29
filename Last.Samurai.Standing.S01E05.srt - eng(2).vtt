kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:00:12.188 --> 00:00:13.771
Specters.

00:00:20.855 --> 00:00:23.355
They cling to their decaying privilege…

00:00:26.438 --> 00:00:28.646
and their swords.

00:00:31.146 --> 00:00:32.521
They are too arrogant…

00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:36.563
to accept defeat.

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:41.271
They steal from the powerless.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.063
They mourn their lost dignity.

00:00:48.938 --> 00:00:50.771
Raise the cry of victory!

00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:53.688
The fools dare to rebel.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.438
Smoke signal confirmed.
It's a victory for our allies.

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:06.063
Open fire.

00:01:07.146 --> 00:01:08.230
Sir?

00:01:09.146 --> 00:01:09.980
Fire.

00:01:10.063 --> 00:01:11.938
Our units are still behind enemy lines--

00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:13.563
Fire now!

00:01:16.396 --> 00:01:18.646
Commence firing!

00:01:24.646 --> 00:01:25.813
Aim!

00:01:25.896 --> 00:01:26.855
Fire!

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.188
Stop! Stop it!

00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:33.105
It's over!

00:01:39.896 --> 00:01:42.688
Stop!

00:01:56.563 --> 00:01:58.605
Those fools…

00:02:00.896 --> 00:02:04.105
are the least fit for the new age.

00:02:21.271 --> 00:02:22.230
Such specters…

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.771
must be eradicated.

00:02:36.396 --> 00:02:39.605
Gentlemen, apologies
for keeping you waiting.

00:03:16.355 --> 00:03:18.980
You've given us
such an amazing opportunity.

00:03:19.063 --> 00:03:21.146
We're the ones who should be thanking you.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.646
Indeed.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.188
Have you heard
of our family motto, Organizer?

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:27.355
No, I'm afraid I haven't.

00:03:27.438 --> 00:03:30.063
"Never lend money to the shizoku."

00:03:30.146 --> 00:03:33.021
No one has suffered more
from their lawlessness than we have.

00:03:33.105 --> 00:03:35.646
Every time we lend them money,
they walk away with it.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.938
I don't know how we've survived.

00:03:38.438 --> 00:03:43.480
Number 159, Tekkan Ikeuchi,
fell at Kuwana-juku.

00:03:44.063 --> 00:03:47.188
Reportedly, he was killed
by number 66, Bukotsu Kanjiya.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.521
Bukotsu the Savage Slasher again?

00:03:51.605 --> 00:03:53.938
-He's a beast, through and through.
-Absolutely.

00:03:54.021 --> 00:03:57.021
But he only cares about killing,
not about making progress.

00:03:57.105 --> 00:03:58.313
Hardly worth betting on.

00:03:58.396 --> 00:04:01.230
He's nowhere near being
the first through Chiryu-juku.

00:04:01.313 --> 00:04:02.271
Exactly.

00:04:02.355 --> 00:04:06.313
-He can't die without entertaining us.
-I couldn't agree more.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.271
The real fun of Kodoku is just beginning.

00:04:11.313 --> 00:04:15.855
We've prepared plenty of entertainment
from start to finish.

00:04:16.438 --> 00:04:22.563
So let us savor the downfall of those
pathetic specters together, gentlemen.

00:04:24.146 --> 00:04:26.730
MITSUI BANK

00:04:36.188 --> 00:04:37.813
Do you despise guns?

00:04:39.313 --> 00:04:43.605
They are what buried us samurai
as the dead.

00:04:45.021 --> 00:04:47.021
No one is to blame for our fall.

00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:51.063
The times have merely changed.

00:04:51.855 --> 00:04:52.938
The times…

00:04:58.355 --> 00:04:59.563
Lower your guns.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.355
He can't focus.

00:06:19.021 --> 00:06:20.313
Move aside!

00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:02.938
-What is it? What happened?
-I heard a gunshot!

00:08:12.521 --> 00:08:13.563
Stop right there.

00:08:14.855 --> 00:08:16.230
Stop! Stop!

00:08:22.771 --> 00:08:24.188
Wait! Hey!

00:08:44.896 --> 00:08:46.980
Head to the front! Don't let him get away!

00:08:49.355 --> 00:08:50.480
Time to move!

00:08:51.063 --> 00:08:51.938
Wait!

00:08:53.021 --> 00:08:53.855
Hey!

00:08:54.438 --> 00:08:56.855
Wait! Come on!

00:09:58.605 --> 00:10:00.521
Even if you keep
pushing forward like this,

00:10:01.271 --> 00:10:03.855
there's no happiness
waiting for any of you.

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:06.771
What's that supposed to mean?

00:10:07.355 --> 00:10:09.563
You don't need
to understand what it means!

00:10:16.188 --> 00:10:18.271
This is the end of the road for you,

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.146
Kokushu Saga!

00:10:42.563 --> 00:10:43.646
Shu-nii!

00:10:47.855 --> 00:10:49.146
Come on!

00:11:09.896 --> 00:11:11.355
We shall meet again in Tokyo.

00:11:21.063 --> 00:11:21.896
Enter.

00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:30.688
We have news
from Superintendent General Kawaji.

00:11:32.021 --> 00:11:34.896
Apparently, they found nothing
at the foot of Mount Fuji.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.146
It was empty.

00:11:36.646 --> 00:11:37.896
Thank you.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.771
Lord Okubo, regarding what Maejima
mentioned before…

00:11:43.938 --> 00:11:44.855
Concerning Kawaji?

00:11:44.938 --> 00:11:46.063
Yes.

00:11:46.646 --> 00:11:49.480
Kawaji is an honorable man.

00:11:49.563 --> 00:11:52.230
-But still--
-To maintain order in this country,

00:11:52.313 --> 00:11:54.813
Kawaji traveled
as far as Europe on a study tour

00:11:54.896 --> 00:11:57.688
and established the Police Bureau himself.

00:12:00.855 --> 00:12:03.355
I do not believe that man would betray us.

00:12:08.563 --> 00:12:09.688
Those documents…

00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:12.396
May I borrow them?

00:12:14.355 --> 00:12:15.438
Can you crack it?

00:12:15.938 --> 00:12:17.938
I don't know.

00:12:18.438 --> 00:12:19.980
But I can try.

00:12:20.688 --> 00:12:24.730
I want to do whatever I can.

00:12:31.896 --> 00:12:33.063
Handle them carefully.

00:12:33.896 --> 00:12:36.188
We have no idea
where the enemy might be hiding.

00:12:36.896 --> 00:12:38.188
Thank you, sir.

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:55.771
The one who killed Akayama
and attacked me wasn't a fake.

00:12:55.855 --> 00:12:57.563
He was a real police officer.

00:12:59.063 --> 00:13:01.855
Which means whoever's running Kodoku

00:13:01.938 --> 00:13:04.938
is connected to the Police Bureau.
Or perhaps--

00:13:05.021 --> 00:13:07.313
Someone inside the Police Bureau.

00:13:07.396 --> 00:13:08.771
That's what I'm thinking.

00:13:08.855 --> 00:13:12.396
So the Police Bureau and Mitsui Bank.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.980
It might not just be the bank.

00:13:15.563 --> 00:13:16.521
What do you mean?

00:13:16.605 --> 00:13:20.105
The zaibatsu that runs the bank
could be connected too.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.438
When you look at it that way,
it all starts to come together.

00:13:25.605 --> 00:13:27.980
The Police Bureau
monitors the participants

00:13:28.063 --> 00:13:31.980
and disposes of any dead bodies.

00:13:32.563 --> 00:13:36.813
The enormous costs needed for that
are covered by the zaibatsu.

00:13:36.896 --> 00:13:38.646
But one thing doesn't make sense.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:42.063
Jinbe Ando, who died first
at Tenryuji Temple,

00:13:42.146 --> 00:13:44.980
was from Kyoto Prefectural
Police Department's Fourth Division.

00:13:45.063 --> 00:13:48.230
That's right. Even the police station
Kyojin snuck into--

00:13:48.313 --> 00:13:52.063
So it's only the central Police Bureau
that is involved.

00:13:53.438 --> 00:13:55.438
Wait, but why would the police…

00:13:55.521 --> 00:14:00.980
I have no clue.
But I can tell you one thing for sure.

00:14:02.771 --> 00:14:05.771
Kodoku isn't just a simple game

00:14:05.855 --> 00:14:08.688
where the survivor walks away
with 100,000 yen.

00:14:09.271 --> 00:14:13.355
Even after reaching Tokyo,
something is bound to happen.

00:14:13.855 --> 00:14:16.646
If one of us
wants to be the last one standing,

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.896
there's a chance
we may end up killing each other.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.938
Even if you're the last one left,

00:14:23.938 --> 00:14:26.480
there's no guarantee you'll return alive.

00:14:28.438 --> 00:14:29.563
How could they?

00:14:33.105 --> 00:14:34.438
But even so,

00:14:35.896 --> 00:14:37.313
I'll keep moving forward.

00:14:39.396 --> 00:14:41.605
With the little miss in tow?

00:14:45.605 --> 00:14:47.980
Maybe this is as far
as you can go with her.

00:14:55.021 --> 00:14:56.521
I'm going.

00:15:00.938 --> 00:15:02.188
Futaba…

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.563
Stay quiet.

00:15:12.313 --> 00:15:16.105
Are you forgetting the one trump card
only you can play,

00:15:16.188 --> 00:15:18.021
Kokushu Saga?

00:15:19.813 --> 00:15:24.021
During the war, you were connected
to some big names in the government.

00:15:25.188 --> 00:15:27.605
How would you know that?

00:15:28.521 --> 00:15:31.938
That's our only shot
against the zaibatsu and the police.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:40.771
If you really care about her,
you might want to think this through.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:59.188
I'll be back by noon tomorrow.

00:16:00.146 --> 00:16:03.355
Take care of Futaba while I'm gone.

00:16:03.438 --> 00:16:04.605
Got it.

00:16:34.771 --> 00:16:36.980
That kind of swing won't help you.

00:16:41.896 --> 00:16:45.813
Even still. I want to become stronger.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.480
I don't want…

00:16:52.771 --> 00:16:54.896
to drag everyone down anymore.

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:11.271
Strength isn't just about the sword.

00:17:15.605 --> 00:17:17.396
You're weak right now.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.146
You're a girl.

00:17:21.396 --> 00:17:22.438
Still a child.

00:17:27.896 --> 00:17:29.271
But that's just for now.

00:17:32.855 --> 00:17:35.688
You have to discover
a strength that is unique to you.

00:18:04.271 --> 00:18:07.605
NARUMI TELEGRAPH OFFICE

00:18:14.771 --> 00:18:15.855
How can I help you?

00:18:15.938 --> 00:18:17.688
I'd like to send a telegram.

00:18:18.605 --> 00:18:19.813
Yes, of course.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:24.146
Please write the recipient's name
and the message here.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:34.980
SPECIAL EXERCISE BY THE POLICE BUREAU

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.313
Come in.

00:18:41.688 --> 00:18:43.396
-Sorry to interrupt, sir.
-What is it?

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:47.688
We've received a suspicious telegram
addressed to the Home Minister.

00:18:53.271 --> 00:18:54.896
Kokushu Saga…

00:18:59.313 --> 00:19:00.896
I'm going to the telegraph room.

00:19:05.563 --> 00:19:08.563
I'll do it myself. Everyone out, please.

00:19:10.021 --> 00:19:10.896
Yes, sir.

00:19:24.605 --> 00:19:26.480
We've received a response.

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:28.313
What does it say?

00:19:29.063 --> 00:19:30.813
It says, "Details, please."

00:19:30.896 --> 00:19:31.938
Who's the sender?

00:19:33.355 --> 00:19:35.105
It's from Hisoka Maejima.

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.021
How is that possible?

00:19:37.105 --> 00:19:39.230
He's the closest aide
to the Home Minister!

00:19:40.188 --> 00:19:41.771
Would you mind stepping out?

00:19:43.271 --> 00:19:44.980
It's better you don't know.

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:47.896
Oh, right.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.855
Critical incident at Tenryuji Temple.
Has it been confirmed?

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:19.938
Report of shizoku gathering received.
Are you one of them?

00:20:20.521 --> 00:20:21.855
I am one of them.

00:20:22.355 --> 00:20:25.855
There is a child
present among the shizoku.

00:20:26.688 --> 00:20:27.896
Requesting assistance.

00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:34.146
Still investigating.
Requesting full details.

00:20:38.396 --> 00:20:39.396
Rule four.

00:20:39.938 --> 00:20:42.605
You must not speak of this game to anyone.

00:20:47.605 --> 00:20:50.605
Provide protection,
and details will follow.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:55.438
Police involvement is suspected.
Any information?

00:20:56.438 --> 00:20:59.646
Matter of national importance.
Details follow after protection.

00:21:04.771 --> 00:21:08.896
Meet in Okazaki in three days.
Protection to follow there.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:12.396
Understood.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.438
Apologies for startling you.

00:21:24.355 --> 00:21:25.938
Could you send this one too?

00:21:26.021 --> 00:21:27.105
Of course.

00:21:31.438 --> 00:21:32.355
Thank you.

00:21:33.188 --> 00:21:36.646
TO: SHINO SAGA
FROM: SHUJIRO SAGA

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.313
Wait for me. Take care.

00:21:41.021 --> 00:21:42.355
I will return without fail.

00:21:51.396 --> 00:21:53.980
Kokushu Saga seems to be
one of the participants.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.563
Kokushu, you say?

00:21:56.063 --> 00:21:57.230
Yes, sir.

00:21:57.896 --> 00:21:59.396
So he's alive.

00:21:59.896 --> 00:22:02.771
He's requesting protection for a child.

00:22:05.146 --> 00:22:06.563
Any other details?

00:22:07.146 --> 00:22:09.563
When I questioned him
about police involvement,

00:22:09.646 --> 00:22:11.230
he wouldn't give a clear answer.

00:22:11.313 --> 00:22:13.521
But he called it
a matter of national importance.

00:22:14.646 --> 00:22:15.938
There's more.

00:22:16.021 --> 00:22:19.771
The Police Bureau
is mobilizing over 150 police officers

00:22:19.855 --> 00:22:22.355
and conducting exercises in secret.

00:22:23.313 --> 00:22:26.980
The Police Bureau is proceeding with
something without informing us.

00:22:27.063 --> 00:22:28.146
There is no doubt.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:30.271
Kawaji is the head of the Police Bureau.

00:22:30.355 --> 00:22:32.730
No one else
could maintain ties to the zaibatsu

00:22:32.813 --> 00:22:35.438
and exercise this much freedom
in controlling the police.

00:22:38.938 --> 00:22:39.896
Lord Okubo.

00:22:43.355 --> 00:22:44.480
I…

00:22:45.063 --> 00:22:46.146
I will not give up.

00:22:49.896 --> 00:22:53.188
Once Kawaji returns,
I will speak with him myself.

00:22:54.563 --> 00:22:57.313
In the meantime, speed up
deciphering the coded telegrams.

00:22:57.396 --> 00:22:59.563
Without evidence,
he'll talk his way out of it.

00:22:59.646 --> 00:23:03.105
Understood. I'll be on my way
to meet Kokushu myself.

00:23:03.188 --> 00:23:05.021
Make sure to stay alert.

00:23:05.521 --> 00:23:06.355
Yes, sir.

00:23:30.021 --> 00:23:34.146
FIREARMS - EQUIPMENT
WESTERN POLICE SYSTEM

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:38.730
FORMATION OF A MODERN STATE POLICE

00:23:38.813 --> 00:23:40.563
TRAINING IS NECESSARY FOR EMERGENCIES

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.896
Ru… Ru… Ru… Ke…

00:23:47.688 --> 00:23:48.688
One…

00:23:49.563 --> 00:23:50.896
Eleven…

00:23:53.396 --> 00:23:54.771
Eleven…

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:39.688
Sorry for the wait.

00:24:39.771 --> 00:24:41.771
All right then, let's move.

00:24:41.855 --> 00:24:44.188
We're probably the last ones left.

00:24:44.271 --> 00:24:47.188
Most of the participants
have probably passed Chiryu by now.

00:24:47.271 --> 00:24:50.105
Better catch up,
or there won't be any wooden tags left.

00:24:50.688 --> 00:24:52.480
Right. Let's move.

00:25:04.855 --> 00:25:09.563
SEKI

00:25:12.563 --> 00:25:15.813
CHIRYU

00:25:17.938 --> 00:25:21.313
CHIRYU-JUKU
REQUIRED POINTS: 5

00:25:36.188 --> 00:25:38.521
We've been expecting you all.

00:25:39.188 --> 00:25:42.355
Saga, Katsuki, Kinugasa,
your wooden tags, sir and ladies, please.

00:25:42.438 --> 00:25:44.896
Tsuge, Sayama, this way, please sirs.

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:49.646
Shujiro Saga, eight points.

00:25:50.146 --> 00:25:52.646
Futaba Katsuki, seven points.

00:25:53.271 --> 00:25:56.021
And Iroha Kinugasa, eight points.

00:25:58.396 --> 00:26:00.771
You are all cleared to pass Chiryu-juku.

00:26:00.855 --> 00:26:03.313
Kyojin Tsuge, seven points.

00:26:03.813 --> 00:26:06.188
You are cleared to pass Chiryu-juku.

00:26:07.605 --> 00:26:09.771
This blue tag counts for five points.

00:26:09.855 --> 00:26:11.896
Please hand over
five points' worth of tags.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.521
Sayama, your wooden tags, please.

00:26:34.896 --> 00:26:36.021
No…

00:26:36.105 --> 00:26:37.855
Futaba, let's go.

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:39.938
Shujiro!

00:26:41.646 --> 00:26:44.396
-If we give him some of ours…
-Why bring him further?

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.063
He won't make it out alive.

00:26:46.646 --> 00:26:49.230
No! Please, help him!

00:26:50.063 --> 00:26:52.563
We're barely able to survive ourselves.

00:26:53.355 --> 00:26:57.355
He's a fully grown man.
He made the decision to come here.

00:26:57.855 --> 00:27:01.396
It's his life, and he should take
full responsibility for it.

00:27:18.813 --> 00:27:19.730
Futaba.

00:27:22.896 --> 00:27:24.021
Thank you.

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:41.230
I don't know what's going to happen.

00:27:44.021 --> 00:27:47.230
I might be killed as well.

00:27:50.771 --> 00:27:51.771
But…

00:27:55.396 --> 00:27:58.146
If I turn my back on a life
that's right in front of me,

00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:59.938
then even if I survive,

00:28:01.271 --> 00:28:03.438
I won't be able to hold my head high

00:28:04.271 --> 00:28:06.021
in front of my mother.

00:28:11.313 --> 00:28:15.396
All you're doing is prolonging a life
that is already doomed.

00:28:16.188 --> 00:28:18.063
Sayama doesn't have what it takes

00:28:18.146 --> 00:28:21.146
to be one of the nine
who might have a chance to survive.

00:28:25.355 --> 00:28:27.521
He might find another way to stay alive.

00:28:27.605 --> 00:28:29.105
That's irrelevant.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:14.355
Oh, well. I guess she wins.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:21.105
Shinnosuke Sayama, five points.
You are cleared to pass Chiryu-juku.

00:30:24.021 --> 00:30:26.771
Thank you, Futaba.

00:30:30.771 --> 00:30:31.980
Thank you!

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:37.521
Thank you!

00:30:46.355 --> 00:30:47.646
May your journey go well.

00:30:53.771 --> 00:30:55.021
Shujiro…

00:30:56.771 --> 00:30:57.855
I'm sorry.

00:31:00.188 --> 00:31:03.855
I wouldn't have made it this far
without you, and yet…

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:05.813
No,

00:31:06.355 --> 00:31:08.021
you're right, Futaba.

00:31:08.646 --> 00:31:10.480
We can't save everyone.

00:31:11.063 --> 00:31:13.396
But if I turn my back
on someone I can help,

00:31:13.896 --> 00:31:15.813
I'd be too ashamed to face my wife.

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:18.855
Oh, and Futaba, nice work.

00:31:19.438 --> 00:31:20.563
Yes.

00:31:20.646 --> 00:31:22.855
Tsurubami let it slip.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:27.438
If we make it into the final nine,
we might have a chance to survive.

00:31:29.938 --> 00:31:32.730
You're right. He did say that.

00:31:33.813 --> 00:31:38.105
I'm sure the nine who make it to Tokyo
will be made to do something.

00:31:38.605 --> 00:31:42.896
But that doesn't necessarily mean
only one of them will make it out alive.

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:47.063
Still…

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:51.855
Why would the Kodoku
tell us something like that?

00:31:52.896 --> 00:31:56.063
They're not exactly on our side,
but maybe they feel sorry for us.

00:31:57.688 --> 00:31:59.188
Well, not us.

00:32:00.521 --> 00:32:01.396
You, Futaba.

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:07.730
Who knows? You might be the one
who holds the key to Kodoku, Futaba.

00:32:10.146 --> 00:32:12.313
I've finally found a bit of hope.

00:32:13.146 --> 00:32:16.480
And it's thanks to you, Futaba.

00:32:48.063 --> 00:32:50.438
So? What was that about a samurai?

00:32:50.521 --> 00:32:53.521
I saw a samurai with a sword.

00:32:53.605 --> 00:32:55.313
He had a girl with him.

00:33:00.355 --> 00:33:01.813
Kokushu,

00:33:02.438 --> 00:33:04.480
you won't get away this time.

00:33:25.146 --> 00:33:27.938
All right, I guess this is where we split.

00:33:28.021 --> 00:33:28.980
Huh?

00:33:29.063 --> 00:33:31.563
After the mess we made
at the police station,

00:33:31.646 --> 00:33:34.605
Shinnosuke and I might be
on the wanted list by now.

00:33:35.146 --> 00:33:36.146
What?

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:37.313
We'll split up for now

00:33:37.396 --> 00:33:40.271
and go in two groups
until the dust settles.

00:33:40.355 --> 00:33:43.188
-Will you two be okay alone?
-Who do you think I am?

00:33:43.271 --> 00:33:44.521
You watch your backs too.

00:33:44.605 --> 00:33:45.938
We'll find you later.

00:33:47.563 --> 00:33:49.230
Come on, Shinnosuke!

00:33:49.771 --> 00:33:52.771
Wait. Hold on, Kyojin!

00:33:54.855 --> 00:33:56.063
We should get going too.

00:34:36.438 --> 00:34:38.438
EUROPEAN CIPHER MANUAL

00:34:38.521 --> 00:34:40.480
To maintain order in this country,

00:34:40.563 --> 00:34:42.938
Kawaji traveled
as far as Europe on a study tour

00:34:43.021 --> 00:34:45.813
and established the Police Bureau himself.

00:34:59.146 --> 00:35:00.480
N, K…

00:35:02.563 --> 00:35:06.521
W, D, A, C…

00:35:07.105 --> 00:35:08.271
L…

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:11.188
I…

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:50.730
Good evening, Shinpei.

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:54.938
Mochizuki…

00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:00.355
What brings someone from the Police Bureau
to the Home Ministry?

00:36:01.146 --> 00:36:04.771
Still working at this time of night?

00:36:09.855 --> 00:36:12.105
You shouldn't have underestimated us.

00:36:13.313 --> 00:36:16.271
Did you think we'd leave
the Home Ministry's elite unwatched?

00:36:18.938 --> 00:36:20.605
What are you really after?

00:36:20.688 --> 00:36:22.355
That's not for you to know.

00:36:26.438 --> 00:36:28.271
Almost made it.

00:36:30.355 --> 00:36:31.521
Too bad.

00:36:49.855 --> 00:36:53.355
REPORT TO KAWAJI
SAKURA AND SHUJIRO FACE-TO-FACE

00:37:04.855 --> 00:37:07.938
TO TOSHIYOSHI KAWAJI

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.896
Looks like there won't be
any more developments today.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.896
Suppose it's about time to take some rest?

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:22.813
Yes. Everyone, please rest well
in your bedrooms.

00:37:22.896 --> 00:37:26.355
I believe the results
from Chiryu will be in by tomorrow.

00:37:26.438 --> 00:37:28.646
Well then, see you all tomorrow.

00:37:30.646 --> 00:37:32.646
The Yoshida twins really are pathetic.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:36.021
-Okubo's secretary has been taken care of.
-Good.

00:37:36.105 --> 00:37:39.646
Still, things are getting a little hectic
at the central government.

00:37:41.063 --> 00:37:44.605
Maejima suddenly changed his schedule
and is heading for Okazaki.

00:37:45.105 --> 00:37:50.063
Evidence suggests he exchanged telegrams
from Tokyo with a Kodoku participant.

00:37:50.146 --> 00:37:51.355
Who did he contact?

00:37:51.438 --> 00:37:53.105
Number 108, Shujiro Saga.

00:37:59.521 --> 00:38:00.355
Pardon me.

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:05.813
Gentlemen, we have a bit of a situation.z

00:38:07.105 --> 00:38:13.146
Okubo may have learned that you
and the Police Bureau are involved.

00:38:15.563 --> 00:38:16.980
What do you mean?

00:38:17.063 --> 00:38:19.396
If that's true, we could be--

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:23.813
Please rest assured.
It's all going as expected.

00:38:24.355 --> 00:38:26.188
I have a plan.

00:38:26.688 --> 00:38:29.730
How on earth did the central government
find out who we are?

00:38:29.813 --> 00:38:34.896
It seems one of the participants leaked
information to Maejima via telegram.

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.771
What? Isn't that against the rules?

00:38:37.855 --> 00:38:40.105
Number 108, Shujiro Saga.

00:38:40.188 --> 00:38:43.938
Kokushu the Manslayer… Is he disqualified?

00:38:44.021 --> 00:38:45.646
He won't be disqualified for that.

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:46.896
But Organizer--

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:48.813
Easy now. Let's all stay calm.

00:38:50.313 --> 00:38:51.938
According to reports,

00:38:52.021 --> 00:38:57.105
some rather intriguing participants
are starting to join Shujiro Saga.

00:39:00.563 --> 00:39:02.355
How about we let

00:39:03.146 --> 00:39:05.438
the specters fight each other

00:39:05.938 --> 00:39:08.813
to the death in Kodoku?

00:39:27.688 --> 00:39:29.021
A festival…

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:52.896
Got a moment to chat, Gion Sansuke?

00:39:54.146 --> 00:39:55.230
Who are you?

00:39:55.313 --> 00:39:57.563
Oh, who knows?

00:40:02.313 --> 00:40:07.480
I've got no intention of fighting you,
Shikura Adashino.

00:40:13.021 --> 00:40:16.105
You guys are looking
for your siblings in Kodoku, right?

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.896
Shujiro Saga and Iroha Kinugasa…

00:40:21.896 --> 00:40:24.313
Oh, and Jinroku
was there too if I'm not mistaken.

00:40:24.396 --> 00:40:26.063
What do you want from us?

00:40:27.771 --> 00:40:28.855
I wonder…

00:40:29.813 --> 00:40:33.021
Would you be interested
if your siblings were in serious trouble?

00:40:46.646 --> 00:40:49.646
Excuse me, which way is Chiryu-juku?

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:51.521
-Pardon me?
-I think I got lost.

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.063
Tell us the details.

00:41:20.188 --> 00:41:22.813
63 REMAINING

00:45:16.688 --> 00:45:19.688
