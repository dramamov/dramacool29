00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.619
What woman?

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.100
Honey,

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:59.500
do not come out alone.

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:00.979
If you get hurt,

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:02.299
I'd be heartbroken.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.740
Honey,

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.299
who are you talking to?

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.859
I thought I heard

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.700
you said

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.319
someone can only be your woman.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.780
I was talking to Mu Feng.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.480
Ms. Lin,

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:16.900
I'm reporting to Dong.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.099
You have

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.459
many admirers in the group.

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:20.379
Who knew

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.180
this would irritate him?

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.159
He declares

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:24.700
you can only be his woman.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.359
The jealousy

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:26.459
really reeks!

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:28.579
Honey,

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:30.840
I do have many admirers,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.620
but my heart belongs only to you.

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:33.939
No need for jealousy.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:35.299
Honey,

00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:36.540
how could

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.739
I not feel jealous?

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:39.019
Whoever loves you

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:40.019
would feel jealous.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.560
You

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.299
will only belong to me.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.219
Then prove it to me.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.500
I won't disappoint you.

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:52.019
Honey,

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:54.420
I have a gift for you.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.859
What is it?

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:05.859
What's this?

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.180
This

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:11.340
is a love bell.

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:15.379
From now on,

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:16.780
wherever you go,

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:18.780
it'll jingle.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.500
Thus,

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.819
I can immediately

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.099
know your location

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.300
to prevent accidental bumps.

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:31.780
Thank you.

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:33.939
(With this bell)

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.060
(you won't eavesdrop on my secrets).

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.840
By the way,

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.099
at the board meeting next Monday,

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.439
I'll finalize the appointments.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.960
Good.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.219
As you wish.

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:49.659
But for now,

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.539
let's set work aside.

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:55.259
I need to handle you first,

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:58.699
my little bell.

00:03:10.163 --> 00:03:13.465
(Cheng Nuo Plastic Surgery Clinic)

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.120
Come in.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.979
Mr. Cheng, I'm leaving first.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.740
Is everyone else

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:46.620
gone?

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:47.259
Yes.

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:48.180
Rest early too.

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:49.319
Alright.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.219
Don't forget to lock up.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.800
Got it.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:01.379
Honey,

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:03.620
I'm here.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.860
I'm sorry

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.779
to let you lie here alone.

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:16.579
You must be freezing.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:18.579
But rest assured,

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:21.939
I'll avenge you.

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:23.839
I'll make the killer

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:25.779
pay blood

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:27.660
for blood.

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.899
Mom!

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:45.819
You scared me to death!

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:48.060
Time's up.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.779
Come down now.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.779
Honey.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.100
Honey.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.620
By the way,

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:13.579
have you confirmed

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:14.819
with Bai Cha?

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:15.800
Yes,

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:17.420
a cliff-fall accident.

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:19.339
She's discharged from ICU.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.860
I feel that Ye Dong

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:24.980
looks familiar.

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:27.500
There's something between

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.779
Bai Cha and him.

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:31.699
Find time

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.860
to investigate

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:34.279
their background.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:36.379
Master,

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:37.660
is that necessary?

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:38.879
The case has been closed.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.019
Why bother

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:41.139
with these efforts?

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.819
There must be more to it.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.860
Ye Dong will take over

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:45.620
as the acting CEO

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.699
of Jiuyao Group.

00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:49.079
Jiuyao's very complicated.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.660
Certain people

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:52.439
won't let him rise so easily.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.660
There might

00:06:54.019 --> 00:06:54.740
be accidents.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.740
With his complete profile,

00:06:57.699 --> 00:06:58.500
we can handle

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:00.860
any potential emergencies.

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:02.819
Take the initiative.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:03.500
Understand?

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.019
Understood.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:09.620
Ye Dong.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.300
It hurts.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.180
Just give me

00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:52.019
a quick end!

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.600
Be patient.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.100
As I finish inserting these 12 needles,

00:07:57.399 --> 00:07:58.860
your prosperous fate

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.180
will belong to my son.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:05.540
Mom,

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:07.579
don't kill him yet.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.220
I haven't obtained everything I want.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.579
Don't worry.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.180
Right now,

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.540
he's living a fate worse than death.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:40.580
Dong,

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.139
it's done.

00:08:42.259 --> 00:08:42.899
Dong.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.220
His destiny of wealth and nobility

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.259
now belongs to you.

00:08:49.399 --> 00:08:50.840
From now on, our Ye family

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.899
will rise to greatness.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.539
I suggest you tone it down.

00:08:58.419 --> 00:08:59.659
Keep things civil with Lin Xia.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.480
I need her support

00:09:02.179 --> 00:09:03.259
at the final meeting.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.539
What did you say?

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.659
Are you still defending her?

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:11.139
Are you trying to defy me?

00:09:13.299 --> 00:09:14.460
That's not what I meant.

00:09:15.139 --> 00:09:15.659
Kneel.

00:09:17.559 --> 00:09:18.200
Kneel!

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:36.740
Ungrateful son!

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:12.379
Honey,

00:10:14.379 --> 00:10:16.399
I wish you could really wake up.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.080
I miss you so much.

00:10:31.139 --> 00:10:31.659
Honey,

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.139
hand me the phone.

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.480
I need to call my dad.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.279
Focus on eating.

00:10:39.279 --> 00:10:40.019
No calls at table.

00:10:41.659 --> 00:10:42.179
Honey,

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.659
just call after meal.

00:10:44.799 --> 00:10:45.299
Here.

00:10:45.299 --> 00:10:46.759
I need to call now.

00:10:50.299 --> 00:10:50.820
Fine.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.000
Here.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.460
Baba.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.019
At your service.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.139
Call my father.

00:11:05.639 --> 00:11:06.159
Understood.

00:11:09.059 --> 00:11:09.940
Sorry,

00:11:10.059 --> 00:11:11.940
the subscriber you dialed
is powered off.

00:11:12.419 --> 00:11:13.460
Please try again later.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.220
It's off?

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:16.740
That's impossible.

00:11:18.139 --> 00:11:19.539
Dead batteries happen.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.059
This isn't normal.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.340
Mr. An always keeps Dad's phone

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.879
and stays active 24 hours a day.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.679
Why would it be off?

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.259
Honey,

00:11:28.659 --> 00:11:30.179
did something happen to Dad?

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:32.700
Nothing would happen to Dad.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:34.019
Don't worry.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.259
After eating,

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:36.440
I'll go check on him.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:37.940
Baba,

00:11:38.059 --> 00:11:38.899
call Mr. An.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:47.320
Hello,

00:11:47.379 --> 00:11:47.899
Miss.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.059
Mr. An,

00:11:49.299 --> 00:11:49.980
where's my dad?

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.360
(Mr. An)
The chairman...

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.019
What's wrong?

00:11:54.259 --> 00:11:56.100
He hasn't been in good health lately.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.940
A severe cold won't go away.

00:11:58.399 --> 00:11:59.659
He asked me not to tell you

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:00.919
to avoid worrying you.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.200
Miss,

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.000
I never told him

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.500
about your car accident,

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.899
lest he be overwhelmed.

00:12:08.139 --> 00:12:08.639
Let me

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:09.820
speak to him.

00:12:11.419 --> 00:12:12.100
Miss,

00:12:12.519 --> 00:12:14.940
it's not a good time now.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.100
Let me speak to him.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.399
He...

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.019
he just fell asleep.

00:12:21.159 --> 00:12:23.039
He's finally resting peacefully.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.799
Maybe when he's better,

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.159
I'll call you back.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.399
Fine.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:29.340
Thank you

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:30.539
for your hard work.

00:12:31.559 --> 00:12:32.139
Not at all.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.480
Goodbye, Miss.

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:36.940
Honey,

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.059
after eating,

00:12:38.179 --> 00:12:39.200
go check on my dad.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:39.919
I'm worried.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:40.740
Okay.

00:12:41.059 --> 00:12:41.679
Don't worry.

00:12:42.019 --> 00:12:43.139
I'll go after dinner.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.539
Rest assured.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.500
Stop overthinking.

00:12:45.919 --> 00:12:47.279
He probably has a mild cold.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.039
Eat up.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.379
Hey,

00:12:58.379 --> 00:12:59.620
what's going on with Mr. An?

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:01.580
Relax.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:02.980
I bought him off.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.740
Tomorrow's Monday.

00:13:04.919 --> 00:13:05.879
After tomorrow,

00:13:07.259 --> 00:13:09.059
we won't need to tread carefully.

00:13:10.679 --> 00:13:11.220
Dong,

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.179
Bai Cha's husband Cheng...

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:14.960
Cheng Nuo opened

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.480
a plastic surgery clinic.

00:13:18.019 --> 00:13:18.740
Let's go.

00:13:19.179 --> 00:13:19.679
Alright.

00:13:20.019 --> 00:13:20.580
Mom?

00:13:22.419 --> 00:13:23.019
Mom?

00:13:24.779 --> 00:13:25.580
Are you there?

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:31.659
Mom,

00:13:32.139 --> 00:13:33.120
I'm thirsty.

00:13:33.419 --> 00:13:34.740
Can you get me some water?

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:39.220
Mom?

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.100
Mom?

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:49.700
Xia,

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.299
what happened?

00:13:51.419 --> 00:13:51.919
Mom,

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.220
I got scalded by boiling water.

00:13:53.419 --> 00:13:54.019
Please take me

00:13:54.019 --> 00:13:54.860
to rinse my hands.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.019
Look at you.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.419
Not only blind,

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:58.539
but also clueless!

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.299
When Ye Dong comes back,

00:14:00.379 --> 00:14:01.379
he'll blame me for sure.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:02.580
Let me see.

00:14:03.299 --> 00:14:04.500
Mom, don't.

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:05.139
It hurts.

00:14:05.139 --> 00:14:05.820
It hurts!

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.340
Come on.

00:14:07.419 --> 00:14:08.500
Let's go to the bathroom.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.019
Mom?

00:14:14.159 --> 00:14:14.659
Here.

00:14:14.659 --> 00:14:15.259
Xia,

00:14:15.779 --> 00:14:16.659
stand still.

00:14:17.299 --> 00:14:18.259
Let me help.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:20.379
Mom!

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.659
The pressure's too high.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:23.740
I can't control it.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.700
You're completely drenched.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.139
Drenched through!

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.659
Turn it off!

00:14:31.019 --> 00:14:31.980
Stop it!

00:14:48.779 --> 00:14:49.419
Xia,

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.179
I'll get you dry clothes.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:52.899
Don't move around.

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:54.179
Be careful not to slip.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:56.580
Mom?

00:14:56.779 --> 00:14:57.620
Mom?

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:03.460
Mom?
