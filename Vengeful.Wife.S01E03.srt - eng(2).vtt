00:00:52.468 --> 00:00:56.128
(Basement of the Lin Family Villa)

00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:33.472
(Lin Xia's Father)

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:35.459
Water.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.500
Give me...

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:37.420
Give me water.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.420
Let me drink water.

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:43.620
Water.

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.780
Water.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.219
Beast.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.700
What exactly are you trying to do?

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.460
Nothing.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.460
It's just my pride acting up.

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:14.819
This is a world

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.219
that values cause and effect.

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:18.699
When you

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.479
looked down on me years ago,

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.580
humiliated and belittled

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.020
me publicly

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:25.139
and privately,

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.840
and said I wasn't good enough
for your daughter,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.740
you sealed today's bitter fate.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.340
From the first moment I saw you,

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.900
I knew you had a rotten character.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.860
Father,

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.419
if

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.020
you weren't the chairman
of Jiuyao Group,

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:46.860
just an ordinary man,

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.900
a regular father,

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.419
you

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:52.939
wouldn't have looked at me that way,

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.900
right?

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.259
Ye Dong.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.900
Promise me.

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:00.939
Let me go.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.340
Disappear from Lin Xia's life

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.379
forever.

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.819
I'll give you 20%
of Jiuyao Group's shares

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:08.580
and cash...

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.020
Name any amount you want.

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.580
Enough for lifetimes.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.460
Father,

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.340
don't you see how stupid you are?

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.020
I meticulously approached Lin Xia,

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.900
set up a hero-saves-damsel trap,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.300
and used love and warmth,

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:31.500
step by step,

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:33.979
to trap her.

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:36.699
What do you think

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.300
is my goal?

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.340
Beast.

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:43.099
You're nothing but a beast!

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.740
Obviously,

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.780
I want to take everything from her.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.740
Darling.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.259
I can't see anything.

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:11.180
Why bother with makeup?

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:12.340
I'll do your makeup

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:13.620
and make you gorgeous.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.060
You're blind.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.379
But your husband isn't dead.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.259
Darling.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.500
Stop the nonsense.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:20.459
Take that back.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:22.579
Okay.

00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:23.712
I take it back.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.060
I've got a loose tongue.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.240
Punishable.

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.839
Oh, right.

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:29.459
Darling.

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.459
Are the board meeting documents ready?

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:33.060
All prepared.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.019
Don't worry.

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:34.980
It's foolproof.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.060
Just waiting for our chairperson

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.860
to sign them.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.100
Bring them here then.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.120
Okay.

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:49.759
Here.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.620
They're here.

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:52.439
Good.

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.344
(Signature)

00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:01.856
(Acting CEO Appointment Document)

00:05:03.411 --> 00:05:05.184
(Share Transfer Agreement)

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:06.439
Here.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.699
Okay.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:25.579
It's Mom's call.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.939
She might be here.

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:27.819
I'll go get her.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.620
Honey,

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:29.579
wait here for me.

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:30.259
I'll be back.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.120
Okay.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.680
Darling.

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:33.139
Explain to Mom

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.339
about my eyes.

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:35.860
It's inconvenient to greet her.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.819
It's okay.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:37.500
Don't worry.

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:13.139
Honey.

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:16.420
Darling.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.220
Why do you walk so quietly?

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.420
You scared me to death.

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:22.980
Honey.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.500
Why are you alone

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.699
in the basement?

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.980
What if you trip?

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:27.899
Darling.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.740
I just heard

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:31.060
thumping noises.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.779
Something's knocking on the door.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:35.819
Honey.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.459
Are you sure you heard it?

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.740
Yes.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.139
Ever since I lost my sight,

00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:43.500
my hearing's become sharper than ever.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.620
I couldn't have misheard.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:46.600
Alright.

00:07:47.019 --> 00:07:47.899
The basement's damp.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:48.939
Let's go upstairs.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.980
I'll check it out later myself.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:54.680
Darling.

00:07:54.819 --> 00:07:55.579
Did you hear that?

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:56.779
That's the sound.

00:07:57.819 --> 00:07:59.540
There must be something trapped inside.

00:08:03.139 --> 00:08:03.740
Let me open it.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:25.699
Darling.

00:08:26.579 --> 00:08:27.740
What do you see?

00:08:27.899 --> 00:08:28.620
I see

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:30.779
a huge old dog.

00:08:31.819 --> 00:08:32.700
Old dog?

00:08:33.259 --> 00:08:34.539
How could there be a dog here?

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.019
And it's a pitiful thing,

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:39.940
skin and bones from starvation.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.620
Should I make it bark

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:42.419
so you can hear?

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:43.860
There's really a dog?

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.340
Just kidding.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.460
There's no dog.

00:08:48.379 --> 00:08:49.379
The noise probably

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.379
came through the skylight
on the first floor.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:52.580
You misheard.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.379
Skylight?

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.100
That doesn't sound right.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.220
I clearly heard something

00:08:58.299 --> 00:09:00.299
like banging against a door.

00:09:22.139 --> 00:09:22.860
Darling.

00:09:23.179 --> 00:09:24.580
Is there really nothing there?

00:09:25.019 --> 00:09:26.100
Can you check again?

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:32.700
Honey.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.620
The basement's chilly.

00:09:35.779 --> 00:09:36.740
Bad for your recovery.

00:09:37.179 --> 00:09:37.779
Later,

00:09:37.779 --> 00:09:39.019
I'll close the skylight.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.460
No more noises then.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.740
If there's another sound

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:44.940
scaring my wife,

00:09:45.779 --> 00:09:46.940
that won't be good.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.539
Darling.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:51.820
You're so good.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:53.960
Let's go.

00:10:11.659 --> 00:10:12.539
Mom.

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:15.139
Mom, you're here.

00:10:16.419 --> 00:10:18.580
I can't serve you in this state.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.659
Please forgive me.

00:10:21.059 --> 00:10:22.059
How dare I let

00:10:22.059 --> 00:10:23.740
a pampered princess like you

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.019
wait on me?

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.059
I came here

00:10:27.299 --> 00:10:28.700
to take care of you two

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:29.500
and cleanse

00:10:30.059 --> 00:10:30.940
the bad energy.

00:10:31.019 --> 00:10:31.779
Mom,

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.179
why throw Xia's clothes

00:10:33.179 --> 00:10:34.100
on the floor?

00:10:34.379 --> 00:10:35.500
These are valuable.

00:10:35.899 --> 00:10:36.419
Valuable?

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.740
More valuable than your life?

00:10:39.059 --> 00:10:40.580
You've only been married a few years.

00:10:41.019 --> 00:10:42.059
See this color?

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.379
Red.

00:10:43.539 --> 00:10:44.700
It attracts bloodshed.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.860
No wonder you had
that terrible accident.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.580
Look at you now,

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.259
filled with resentment.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.179
If we don't clear out

00:10:53.559 --> 00:10:54.360
that filth,

00:10:54.679 --> 00:10:55.460
worship the gods

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.659
and perform rituals,

00:10:57.019 --> 00:10:58.259
the next disaster will strike

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.340
the closest person

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.659
to you.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.460
Mom,

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.379
that's enough.

00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:03.779
We have

00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:04.860
important things to do.

00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:06.700
Stay in the first-floor room.

00:11:07.019 --> 00:11:07.860
Rest well.

00:11:12.179 --> 00:11:12.740
Xia,

00:11:13.019 --> 00:11:14.139
I mean well.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.720
Don't take my words

00:11:16.059 --> 00:11:17.980
to heart.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.000
Mom,

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:20.980
we're leaving now.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.100
Dong.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:25.220
Your eyes
