00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:28.416
Oh. Kotaro. Are you okay?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.250
Here. Water.

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:35.541
-Futaba…
-Hm?

00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:40.083
[breathing heavily] Am I…
Do you think I'm gonna die?

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:42.875
Don't you worry.

00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:46.416
It's fine. My mother is praying
to the gods, all right?

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.833
[breath trembling]

00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:56.041

One, two, three, four.

One, two, three,

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:21.750
four.

00:01:24.041 --> 00:01:25.166
Futaba?

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.833
What's the matter?

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.708
Do you think…

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.333
[sighs] Will cholera really go away?

00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:43.916
Father is gone.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.666
People in town are dying
one after another.

00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:50.833
And yet,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.166
we're still here, praying to the gods.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.083
Futaba.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.916
In this world, everything
that happens is part of the gods' design.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.791
And for that reason,

00:02:02.875 --> 00:02:05.750
the best thing
we can do in the end is pray.

00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:11.625
Whether it's war, or disease,

00:02:11.708 --> 00:02:14.166
whatever comes our way,
if we keep praying,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.291
the gods will protect us.

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:19.125
We have to believe.

00:02:24.416 --> 00:02:26.583
All right then. Shall we go make supper?

00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:29.541
Yes.

Mother! Mother!

That brat is off your hands now.

00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:00.583
Do it already.

00:05:01.833 --> 00:05:04.083
Are you bullshitting me?

00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:05.166

Kokushu the Manslayer?!

[straining]

00:05:22.416 --> 00:05:24.750
How's your life been since then?

00:05:30.458 --> 00:05:31.708
[Kanjiya laughs]

00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.583
Those bastards in power do what they want.

00:05:38.208 --> 00:05:41.083
They told us to fight and kill
when they needed us.

00:05:41.166 --> 00:05:44.708
But once they didn't,
they told us to throw our swords away.

00:05:45.208 --> 00:05:49.708
That's why I'm grateful to the person
who came up with this whole little race.

00:05:50.208 --> 00:05:51.583
[breathing heavily]

00:05:51.666 --> 00:05:54.708
[Kanjiya] Because it takes me back
to the good old days.

00:05:57.166 --> 00:05:59.916
So let us return to the way we were.

00:06:01.541 --> 00:06:02.375
Shall we?

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.625

That's it.

00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:37.750
This is what I expect
from Kokushu the Manslayer.

[grunting]

00:07:29.125 --> 00:07:30.416
That's more like it.

[dramatic music intensifies]

00:07:53.083 --> 00:07:54.833
What the hell are you doing?!

00:08:03.125 --> 00:08:04.583

[knocking]

00:08:48.416 --> 00:08:50.291
Saga, what happened?
Is everything all right?

00:08:52.458 --> 00:08:54.625
Here, get inside. Come on. Quickly.

00:08:59.416 --> 00:09:01.583
[rain continues falling]

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:02.666
[winces]

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.583
Well, I hope you can get some rest.

00:09:08.666 --> 00:09:10.291
[Saga] Thanks for everything.

00:09:10.375 --> 00:09:12.583
It's nothing.
Just let me know if you need anything.

00:09:12.666 --> 00:09:14.666
Though it's impossible

00:09:15.291 --> 00:09:18.041
to ever repay you
for all that you've done.

00:09:20.125 --> 00:09:21.541
It was ages ago.

00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:27.458
Well, I'll leave you to it.

00:09:34.541 --> 00:09:35.458
[sighs]

00:09:40.541 --> 00:09:42.666
[Saga] So it wasn't rusted after all.

00:09:48.416 --> 00:09:49.375
[sighs]

00:09:50.625 --> 00:09:52.291
You saved me out there.

00:09:52.916 --> 00:09:54.208
Thank you.

00:09:54.791 --> 00:09:58.708
And you too.
Thank you for saving my life, sir.

00:10:00.291 --> 00:10:03.916
I'll take you to the edge
of the Tokaido Road in the morning.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.375
After that, take off your tag and run.

00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:13.083
-It's against the rules.
-[scoffs]

00:10:14.125 --> 00:10:16.333
Your life is more important
than rules, isn't it?

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.958
-I'm not giving up, sir.
-I don't think you understand!

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.875
A child cannot survive this.

00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.500
I can't afford to run away either!

00:10:27.083 --> 00:10:28.375
If I give up,

00:10:29.541 --> 00:10:31.625
countless lives will be lost.

00:10:38.666 --> 00:10:39.625
Cholera?

00:10:44.375 --> 00:10:46.125
[footsteps approaching]

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:51.625
Who is it?

00:10:51.708 --> 00:10:53.250
[man] Calm down. It's just me.

00:10:53.333 --> 00:10:55.666
You know I've got no intention
of fighting you.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.125
[tense music playing]

00:10:57.208 --> 00:10:58.666
What are you doing here?

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.166
[man] Hold on now.
Why don't we talk face-to-face?

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.875
I'll even enter with my hands up.
Just don't stab me, all right?

00:11:11.916 --> 00:11:13.375
It's good to see you.

00:11:14.833 --> 00:11:16.333
What do you want?

00:11:16.416 --> 00:11:18.166
[man] Put your sword down first, will ya?

00:11:19.416 --> 00:11:20.416
[sighs]

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.041
If I wanted to kill you,
I wouldn't come through the front door.

00:11:23.125 --> 00:11:24.333
Go on. You too, little miss.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.916
[inhales]

00:11:30.083 --> 00:11:34.625
[clicks tongue] You're all edge
and no ease, Kokushu the Manslayer.

00:11:36.708 --> 00:11:38.500
How do you know that name anyway?

00:11:38.583 --> 00:11:41.083
[chuckles] That's not what matters
right now, is it?

00:11:41.166 --> 00:11:44.541
I think what you really want to know is
what I'm doing in front of you.

00:11:47.166 --> 00:11:51.583
Well, the thing is I've come bearing
a fine deal for you today.

00:11:52.541 --> 00:11:53.750
What is it?

00:11:54.458 --> 00:11:55.666
[man sighs]

00:11:57.333 --> 00:11:59.750
How would you two like
to form an alliance?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.125
What do you mean?

00:12:04.166 --> 00:12:05.750
What are you planning?

00:12:07.541 --> 00:12:11.708
Well, I just think this Kodoku game is
a little too mysterious for my taste.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:19.416
What do they gain by making
trained swordsmen kill each other?

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.583
Why would they make us travel to Tokyo?

00:12:23.916 --> 00:12:26.708
Are they even serious
about paying us the 100,000 yen?

00:12:28.416 --> 00:12:30.166
And who's organizing this?

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.125
You've been wondering as well, right?

00:12:39.375 --> 00:12:40.416
[inhales deeply]

00:12:41.291 --> 00:12:42.333
I heard someone mention

00:12:42.416 --> 00:12:46.000
that a group of high-ranking officials
might be planning a hunt for swords.

00:12:46.083 --> 00:12:48.708
If that was the case, they should've
killed us at the temple, right?

00:12:48.791 --> 00:12:50.875
Why would they bother
making us do something like this?

00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:52.875
That's true.

00:12:53.375 --> 00:12:55.666
Rumor has it some are out for revenge.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.541
Survivors of the old shogunate
forces are seeking allies.

00:12:58.625 --> 00:13:00.333
Right. I've also heard

00:13:00.416 --> 00:13:04.000
that foreigners are trying
to spark a civil war to destroy Japan.

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:06.666
Anyway, the truth is still unknown, right?

00:13:08.416 --> 00:13:11.166
We have no idea what the
organizers are planning,

00:13:13.041 --> 00:13:16.625
nor what they may throw
at us going forward.

00:13:17.416 --> 00:13:18.916
What we do know

00:13:19.916 --> 00:13:23.125
is that whoever's
behind this is seriously powerful.

00:13:24.375 --> 00:13:25.791
It would be wiser to work together.

00:13:25.875 --> 00:13:28.833
We have better chances
of gathering information as a group.

00:13:29.416 --> 00:13:31.375
The sooner we learn who they are,

00:13:31.458 --> 00:13:34.458
the closer we become to the 100,000 yen.

00:13:37.208 --> 00:13:41.291
Well, then.
Is that enough to satisfy your curiosity?

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:50.291
How will everything be taken care of?
There won't be any issues, right?

00:13:51.208 --> 00:13:54.791
It'll be as it was by morning.
No one will suspect it.

00:13:54.875 --> 00:13:56.916
So, how many are left then?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.083
The current count of those
who have survived now stands at 128.

00:14:01.166 --> 00:14:04.750
[chuckles] That's more than I anticipated.

00:14:05.375 --> 00:14:08.833
As expected,
the samurai are as tenacious as ever.

00:14:08.916 --> 00:14:11.916
The stench of blood, though…
Quite remarkable, don't you think?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.333
[laughs]

00:14:14.333 --> 00:14:17.833
The organizer will be joining you
in just a few minutes.

00:14:17.916 --> 00:14:19.583
In the meantime, please relax.

00:14:19.666 --> 00:14:22.416
Enjoy your stay,
and make yourselves at home.

00:14:24.916 --> 00:14:25.750
[spits]

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.250
[mysterious music playing]

00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.583
We just left Tenryuji Temple,

00:14:33.666 --> 00:14:38.166
and now we're going through Seki,
Chiryu, Hamamatsu, Shimada,

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.458
Hakone and Shinagawa.

00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.583
I tallied the number of participants

00:14:42.666 --> 00:14:44.833
against the number
of tags required to proceed.

00:14:46.083 --> 00:14:49.958
So currently, there are 292 participants.

00:14:50.458 --> 00:14:53.750
And in order to pass through
the final checkpoint in Shinagawa,

00:14:53.833 --> 00:14:56.000
you must have 30 tags.

00:14:56.583 --> 00:14:58.333
So, what does that say?

00:15:02.416 --> 00:15:06.000
It's possible
that several people can make it to Tokyo.

00:15:07.375 --> 00:15:08.916
That is correct.

00:15:09.416 --> 00:15:12.208
The figures show that no more
than nine could reach Tokyo.

00:15:14.375 --> 00:15:15.500
However, we don't know

00:15:15.583 --> 00:15:18.041
if those nine people
will be splitting the reward,

00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:21.250
or if the organizers might have
something else in store.

00:15:21.333 --> 00:15:23.458
It all depends on their goal here.

00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:26.291
In any case, if the limit is nine,

00:15:26.375 --> 00:15:29.750
then the three of us heading
to Tokyo together should be fine, right?

00:15:30.416 --> 00:15:32.708
How's that? Not the worst idea ever.

00:15:37.041 --> 00:15:39.000
Why form an alliance with us?

00:15:41.583 --> 00:15:43.750
You are not cut
from the same cloth as the others,

00:15:43.833 --> 00:15:44.750
wouldn't you agree?

00:15:47.166 --> 00:15:48.041
Also,

00:15:48.666 --> 00:15:52.291
I know for a fact that you won't turn
on me as long as she's with you.

00:15:53.666 --> 00:15:57.333
What do you mean by that?
Do you mean you'll kill her if I do?

00:15:58.916 --> 00:15:59.875
You know that I would.

00:16:00.791 --> 00:16:03.041
Think of her as a hostage, if you will.

00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.583
Well, we'll see
if you end up drawing your sword

00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:09.750
against our very own
little miss after all.

00:16:15.375 --> 00:16:17.500
You don't have to decide right now.

00:16:17.583 --> 00:16:20.458
There's an inn
over in Yokkaichi called Uzuya.

00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:22.750
Three nights from now,

00:16:22.833 --> 00:16:25.208
meet me there
if you do decide you'll join forces.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:29.333
Oh.

00:16:29.416 --> 00:16:31.458
I have one more thing I'd like to say.

00:16:33.333 --> 00:16:35.750
It's not that you're unable to kill.

00:16:35.833 --> 00:16:37.375
You're just choosing not to.

00:16:39.458 --> 00:16:42.416
Once a manslayer, always a manslayer.

00:16:43.083 --> 00:16:44.875
You're nothing but a killer,

00:16:45.375 --> 00:16:46.875
Saga Kokushu.

00:16:49.583 --> 00:16:51.458
I look forward to your answer.

00:16:52.083 --> 00:16:52.916
Wait.

00:16:54.333 --> 00:16:56.083
Just tell me one thing.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.375
What was your reason
for joining this Kodoku?

00:17:02.791 --> 00:17:03.666
Well,

00:17:04.208 --> 00:17:05.875
I don't know, really.

00:17:08.416 --> 00:17:11.583
Maybe I just wanted to witness it,
see how it unfolds.

00:17:13.208 --> 00:17:15.458
The final days of the samurai, that is.

00:17:18.625 --> 00:17:19.541
Well,

00:17:19.625 --> 00:17:21.041
I'll be waiting for the good news.

Futaba,

00:18:01.041 --> 00:18:02.833
I'm so sorry.

00:18:07.125 --> 00:18:09.416
It's all right. Let me handle things here.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:14.416
Please, ma'am.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:15.958
Please, sir.

00:18:16.541 --> 00:18:18.666
Please. Even a little will do.

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.458
It's for the children. Save the children.

00:18:20.541 --> 00:18:23.291

Please. Who in their right mind
would believe this nonsense?

Smells like a lie.

00:18:31.875 --> 00:18:33.625
What? Is it money you're after?

00:18:33.708 --> 00:18:34.666
Yes.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:35.583

[Futaba] Yes.

What were you praying for?

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.458
That everyone might fulfill their lives

and find solace beyond in heaven.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.541
I learned the dance from my mother.

She

But now

But I know that I'm weak.

00:24:14.125 --> 00:24:16.000
I can't survive this by myself.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:22.291
So I'm begging you, sir.

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:26.541
Will you please take me
with you to the end?

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.791
I'll do whatever I can.

HOKOKU NEWSPAPER
PARTICIPANTS WANTED

00:26:58.166 --> 00:27:00.875
[man] We seized a few of these
in Tokyo City the other day.

00:27:02.083 --> 00:27:03.958
Yes, I've been informed of this.

00:27:04.541 --> 00:27:07.750
I wanted to investigate further
before reporting it to you, sir.

00:27:07.833 --> 00:27:10.541
In any case,
100,000 is quite an extraordinary amount.

00:27:10.625 --> 00:27:11.625
Indeed.

Last night at Kyoto's Tenryuji Temple,

00:27:14.541 --> 00:27:17.708
a considerable number
of shizoku were observed assembling.

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:20.458
We have not heard any news
from Ando Jinbe,

00:27:20.541 --> 00:27:22.208
who was sent to infiltrate their meeting.

00:27:22.291 --> 00:27:24.541
Do you think the shizoku are trying
to start a rebellion?

00:27:24.625 --> 00:27:27.166
[Kawaji] We still do not know
what their goal is.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:29.875
However, they are remnants of the samurai,

00:27:29.958 --> 00:27:32.625
so they're definitely stirring up
some scheme in Kyoto.

00:27:32.708 --> 00:27:33.958
And behind them,

00:27:34.041 --> 00:27:35.958
there's someone
with enough financial power

00:27:36.041 --> 00:27:39.166
to circulate forged newspapers
across the entire country.

00:27:39.666 --> 00:27:41.333
As of now, those are the facts.

00:27:45.708 --> 00:27:46.958
the consequences could be dire.

00:27:47.041 --> 00:27:49.125
We have to investigate immediately.

00:27:49.208 --> 00:27:50.708
Mr. Maejima,

00:27:50.791 --> 00:27:52.875
I don't think we need
to be so afraid of them, sir.

00:27:52.958 --> 00:27:56.083
-The shizoku are toothless tigers now.
-Shouldn't underestimate their strength.

00:27:56.166 --> 00:27:59.708
Have you forgotten how badly we suffered
during last year's uprising?

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:03.875
Our nation has only just risen
from the ashes.

00:28:04.875 --> 00:28:06.916
If civil war breaks out once more,

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
our nation will surely be shaken,

00:28:09.083 --> 00:28:11.333
leaving us at the mercy of the West.

00:28:12.666 --> 00:28:13.541
Kawaji.

00:28:14.041 --> 00:28:16.208
Let us launch an investigation.

00:28:16.291 --> 00:28:19.916
As for the person who's behind this,
the mastermind and their intentions?

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.791
-The Police Bureau will find them.
-Sir.

00:28:29.458 --> 00:28:30.458
[door opens]

00:28:31.125 --> 00:28:31.958
[door closes]

00:28:32.541 --> 00:28:33.916
[Kanjiya laughs]

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.250
[groaning]

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.500
[Kanjiya] Did you not hear me?

00:28:39.291 --> 00:28:43.250
Did you see a samurai passing
through here with a kid or not?

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:45.166
[boy whimpering]

00:28:46.083 --> 00:28:47.291
It's no use, huh?

00:28:47.375 --> 00:28:50.375
[gasping] Please have mercy! I beg you!

00:28:50.458 --> 00:28:51.875
-[Kanjiya sighs]
-Have mercy!

00:28:52.625 --> 00:28:53.458
[Kikuomi] You beast.

00:28:54.125 --> 00:28:56.416
Stop attacking non-participants.

00:29:01.625 --> 00:29:03.625
Never seen you before. Who are you?

00:29:03.708 --> 00:29:05.791
Kikuomi Ukyo.

00:29:05.875 --> 00:29:07.000
[Kanjiya] Oh.

00:29:07.083 --> 00:29:10.291
I see. You're the famous
Guardian of the Nobility.

00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:12.708
Seek shelter while you can.

00:29:12.791 --> 00:29:17.375
-[villagers breathing shakily]
-I've heard rumors. What a shame!

00:29:17.458 --> 00:29:18.875
To be tossed aside like that

00:29:18.958 --> 00:29:23.000
after all those years
of loyal service to your master. [laughs]

00:29:23.083 --> 00:29:24.291
[tense music playing]

00:29:24.375 --> 00:29:27.333
So it seems we're in the same boat
at the end of the day, are we not?

00:29:27.416 --> 00:29:28.625
Shut your mouth.

00:29:29.125 --> 00:29:31.416
You and I are nothing alike,
you vile scum.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:32.333
[Kanjiya laughs]

00:29:35.916 --> 00:29:37.666
Let's have some fun.

00:29:49.458 --> 00:29:51.791
[villagers whispering indistinctly]

00:29:57.125 --> 00:29:58.333

[villagers gasping]

00:30:47.416 --> 00:30:49.833
Prancing around
like a damn snake in the grass.

00:30:49.916 --> 00:30:50.750
Enough of that!

00:30:51.333 --> 00:30:53.416
What's wrong? Can't keep up with it?

00:30:54.666 --> 00:30:55.958
[grunting]

00:31:00.666 --> 00:31:01.625
[breathing heavily]

00:31:12.291 --> 00:31:14.166
[Kikuomi] Shall we end this?

00:31:14.666 --> 00:31:15.958
Because frankly,

00:31:16.625 --> 00:31:19.458
my time is far too valuable
to waste on battling you.

00:31:19.958 --> 00:31:22.041
[dramatic music playing]

00:31:25.375 --> 00:31:26.916
[dramatic music fades]

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:31.000
Mr. Ukyo!
You cannot see Lord Kazanin! [panting]

00:31:31.625 --> 00:31:34.250
-[laughing]
-[man] Mr. Ukyo!

00:31:35.458 --> 00:31:36.333
[sighs]

00:31:36.416 --> 00:31:37.583
[Kikuomi] Lord Kazanin.

00:31:38.125 --> 00:31:41.083
Are you truly abandoning
the Kikuomi household?

00:31:41.166 --> 00:31:42.583
I'm eating now.

00:31:45.458 --> 00:31:48.041
Our house, the Kikuomi, have repeatedly

00:31:48.125 --> 00:31:50.916
risked life and limb
to protect your noble lives.

00:31:51.875 --> 00:31:53.875
And this is how you repay us?

00:31:53.958 --> 00:31:55.666
[sniffs] Without their swords,

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.750
the samurai are not worth much
to the world anymore.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.750
The government took your wealth too,
I suppose.

00:32:04.833 --> 00:32:06.583
So if you bow your head and beg,

00:32:06.666 --> 00:32:08.750
I just might consider
hiring you as my servant.

00:32:08.833 --> 00:32:10.375
-[inhales sharply]
-[men laugh]

00:32:10.458 --> 00:32:11.583
[tense music playing]

00:32:11.666 --> 00:32:12.708
Miserable cur!

00:32:13.291 --> 00:32:14.416
[officer 1] Don't move!

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.125
[officer 2] Take your hand off your sword!

00:32:21.875 --> 00:32:22.791
[somber music playing]

00:32:22.875 --> 00:32:24.458
Get him out of here!

00:32:25.166 --> 00:32:26.583
Hands off!

00:32:28.625 --> 00:32:30.250
I'll walk out on my own.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:36.875
Lowborn fool with highborn airs.

00:32:37.416 --> 00:32:38.500
[men laugh]

00:32:43.416 --> 00:32:44.666
My Lord,

00:32:45.458 --> 00:32:46.750
we can go no further.

00:32:48.125 --> 00:32:50.166
We sold everything we could.

00:32:51.708 --> 00:32:52.666
The only thing left

00:32:54.208 --> 00:32:55.333
is this.

00:32:57.875 --> 00:32:59.791
They've taken our purpose from us.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.833
Now we're being driven
into selling our pride to survive.

00:33:06.916 --> 00:33:08.666
That is too much to bear.

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:09.666
[breath trembling]

00:33:11.416 --> 00:33:13.500
Committing seppuku and ending our lives

00:33:15.375 --> 00:33:17.666
is the only path to protect our pride.

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:23.416
[Kikuomi] I have heard your thoughts.

00:33:25.416 --> 00:33:26.916
I understand your feelings.

00:33:29.041 --> 00:33:30.708
The Kikuomi family

00:33:31.916 --> 00:33:34.500
will have its glory restored,
I give you my word.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.166
We're with you, Lord Ukyo.

00:33:38.458 --> 00:33:39.541

Oh.

-Don't come any closer.

[Tachikawa] What?

00:35:18.375 --> 00:35:22.125
No, wait, wait, wait! No, no, don't!
We don't want to fight. We've had enough!

00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:28.958
Uh, we're going to quit this game!

00:35:29.041 --> 00:35:31.666
Stand with us, please. Join our cause!

00:35:32.666 --> 00:35:33.916
What are you saying?

00:35:36.416 --> 00:35:38.583
We were tricked into this thing! Right?

00:35:38.666 --> 00:35:39.666
-Yeah!
-That's right!

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:41.875
-This game is absurd!
-They tricked us into this!

00:35:41.958 --> 00:35:45.750
[groans] We don't stand a chance.
Everyone else is too strong.

00:35:45.833 --> 00:35:49.166
And then they took all our tags we won,
the tags we risked our necks for!

00:35:50.416 --> 00:35:53.500
-I'm sure the prize money is a lie too!
-[man] He's right.

00:35:55.208 --> 00:35:58.875
[Tachikawa whimpers] So please. Join us.

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:01.708
I'm begging you.

00:36:02.416 --> 00:36:04.375
We need more people in our cause.

00:36:05.375 --> 00:36:07.416
You can't leave now. It's too late.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.583
They'll kill you
if you break the rules, you know that.

00:36:09.666 --> 00:36:10.666
No.

00:36:11.208 --> 00:36:12.750
They won't. Look!

00:36:12.833 --> 00:36:15.625
Even they wouldn't dare.
Not with all these people.

00:36:15.708 --> 00:36:16.666
Right?

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:22.916
It's nonsense.
Why should we be killing each other?

00:36:26.875 --> 00:36:29.666
Over something as trivial as this?

00:36:31.291 --> 00:36:32.125
I…

00:36:33.083 --> 00:36:36.958

You act like
you're some kind of gods, right?

how shall we proceed?

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:45.416
Let the organizer know.
