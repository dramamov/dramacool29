kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:31.063
Not enough.

00:00:35.313 --> 00:00:36.771
Not enough!

00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:45.313
Kokushu the Manslayer.

00:00:46.105 --> 00:00:48.063
I haven't had enough fun yet.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.271
Let's fight to the death.

00:00:53.313 --> 00:00:55.021
The battle is over.

00:00:58.313 --> 00:01:00.188
But we're samurai.

00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:02.355
We fight on regardless.

00:01:04.646 --> 00:01:06.771
It ends too quickly, huh?

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.271
These sons of bitches
with their rifles and cannons.

00:01:14.813 --> 00:01:15.688
See?

00:01:16.605 --> 00:01:18.396
That's all it takes.

00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:21.313
It doesn't even feel like killing.

00:01:21.813 --> 00:01:23.855
What a civilized weapon.

00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:29.605
The age of the sword is coming to an end.

00:01:32.938 --> 00:01:35.146
Manslayers like us are no longer needed.

00:01:35.646 --> 00:01:38.230
That doesn't change who we are inside.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.271
We'll always be manslayers.

00:01:43.855 --> 00:01:47.438
I liked the way you killed back there.

00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:51.105
Come and show me how you do it.

00:02:26.188 --> 00:02:28.355
You feel like fighting me yet?

00:02:54.563 --> 00:02:56.105
Kill me.

00:03:02.896 --> 00:03:05.063
If you don't kill me now,

00:03:05.146 --> 00:03:07.896
I'll hunt you down
for the rest of my life.

00:03:12.146 --> 00:03:13.730
It's over now.

00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:27.105
We'll meet again, all right?!

00:03:28.396 --> 00:03:31.021
Kokushu the Manslayer!

00:03:52.188 --> 00:03:56.438
The era of the samurai is over.
You just stay here until the day you die.

00:04:23.105 --> 00:04:26.480
I wanna fight…

00:04:38.438 --> 00:04:42.313
What a sorry sight you make,
Bukotsu Kanjiya.

00:04:43.646 --> 00:04:46.105
You disappeared ten years ago,

00:04:46.605 --> 00:04:49.105
then suddenly reemerged
for the Satsuma Rebellion

00:04:49.605 --> 00:04:51.730
and even cut down your own allies.

00:04:55.188 --> 00:04:57.313
How have you lived your life since then?

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.813
How have I lived my life?

00:05:07.646 --> 00:05:09.605
I've been dead

00:05:10.855 --> 00:05:12.646
this whole time.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.605
I'm going to give you another chance
to live as a samurai.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.688
Huh?

00:05:34.855 --> 00:05:36.438
HOKOKU NEWSPAPER
PARTICIPANTS WANTED

00:06:01.396 --> 00:06:03.063
Hey! What's going on?!

00:06:49.771 --> 00:06:53.105
LAST SAMURAI STANDING

00:06:57.688 --> 00:06:58.855
TO TOSHIYOSHI KAWAJI

00:06:58.938 --> 00:07:02.480
WE MUST DISCUSS THE FUTURE OF THE POLICE.
I AWAIT YOU IN TOKYO.

00:07:06.063 --> 00:07:07.521
Lord Okubo!

00:07:12.438 --> 00:07:15.230
Lord Okubo, please.

00:07:15.313 --> 00:07:18.188
If we don't exterminate
the shizoku in this war,

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:21.355
they're sure to revolt
against the new age!

00:07:21.438 --> 00:07:24.938
Please grant the police officers
permission to carry guns.

00:07:26.563 --> 00:07:28.563
-I will not.
-Why?

00:07:29.063 --> 00:07:33.230
How are we supposed to protect you
from a potential assassination attempt?

00:07:33.313 --> 00:07:35.063
Take their swords away.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.771
-I will allow no more than that.
-Mr. Okubo!

00:07:40.396 --> 00:07:44.771
Heavy-handed oppression
will only result in more uprisings.

00:07:44.855 --> 00:07:47.730
Recall what happened in Kyoto
at the end of the Edo period.

00:07:47.813 --> 00:07:52.938
How many of our comrades fell
to the shizoku's swords!

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:59.480
If highly skilled samurai were to plot
our assassination, we couldn't stop them!

00:07:59.563 --> 00:08:03.771
We need guns to protect Japan
in the coming era!

00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:07.396
What good does it do
to use force against force?!

00:08:08.605 --> 00:08:14.146
What do you think Japan needs
in order to grow strong as a nation?

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.146
-The people!
-It's the people I want to protect!

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:21.396
You cannot win public support by force!
Do you not understand that?!

00:08:25.813 --> 00:08:26.896
Kawaji.

00:08:28.688 --> 00:08:30.813
The shizoku will no longer be needed.

00:08:31.313 --> 00:08:32.271
However,

00:08:33.355 --> 00:08:36.688
unless we find a way to coexist…

00:08:40.188 --> 00:08:42.271
this country has no future.

00:09:05.188 --> 00:09:08.938
I… will not give up.

00:09:58.896 --> 00:10:05.896
THE KODOKU PROJECT

00:10:10.646 --> 00:10:11.855
Mr. Kawaji.

00:10:15.355 --> 00:10:16.355
Come in.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.813
Excuse me, sir.

00:10:23.938 --> 00:10:26.771
A telegram from Okubo for you.

00:10:29.188 --> 00:10:30.855
To Toshiyoshi Kawaji.

00:10:31.355 --> 00:10:35.855
We must discuss the future of the police.

00:10:36.355 --> 00:10:38.355
I await you in Tokyo.

00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:26.980
-Futaba.
-Yes?

00:11:27.563 --> 00:11:28.563
Go join them.

00:11:30.521 --> 00:11:32.938
-Is that all right?
-Yeah.

00:11:36.396 --> 00:11:37.855
Thank you.

00:11:42.063 --> 00:11:42.980
You sure?

00:11:44.063 --> 00:11:46.230
We have two days until the rendezvous.

00:11:46.313 --> 00:11:47.313
And besides,

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.688
these could be our last days together.

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:12.355
So that's how you look now.

00:12:14.105 --> 00:12:15.313
How I look now?

00:12:18.438 --> 00:12:21.688
Like a father watching his child.

00:12:30.771 --> 00:12:33.146
Did having a family make you happy?

00:12:37.313 --> 00:12:38.146
It did.

00:12:45.813 --> 00:12:47.980
What's it like having a real family?

00:13:20.105 --> 00:13:23.313
I'd sacrifice everything to protect them.

00:13:25.313 --> 00:13:28.521
It taught me a way of life
aside from killing.

00:13:38.438 --> 00:13:39.688
As for me…

00:13:42.605 --> 00:13:44.938
if I knew every day would be like this…

00:13:47.105 --> 00:13:49.855
I'd have been better off dying
in the succession match.

00:13:50.355 --> 00:13:51.813
I've thought that many times.

00:13:53.355 --> 00:13:54.355
Iroha.

00:13:54.896 --> 00:13:56.355
You've got it wrong. I--

00:13:56.438 --> 00:13:57.521
I know.

00:14:01.313 --> 00:14:02.480
I know.

00:14:07.521 --> 00:14:08.855
I'm going for a walk.

00:14:20.521 --> 00:14:22.938
What do you mean,
if our siblings were in trouble?

00:14:23.021 --> 00:14:24.521
Tell us the details.

00:14:24.605 --> 00:14:29.730
Shujiro Saga and Iroha Kinugasa are bound
to get killed unless you do something.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.188
You don't mean…

00:14:33.855 --> 00:14:34.855
Gentosai?

00:14:34.938 --> 00:14:37.730
Hey! Well done. You nailed it.

00:14:37.813 --> 00:14:40.688
There's a festival on
at the shrine up ahead.

00:14:40.771 --> 00:14:42.646
That's where the two of them are.

00:14:43.146 --> 00:14:45.105
As well as Gentosai.

00:14:45.938 --> 00:14:47.021
You…

00:14:47.896 --> 00:14:48.813
Who are you?

00:14:49.396 --> 00:14:50.813
Good question.

00:14:51.438 --> 00:14:54.063
Lately, I'm not sure
even I know the answer.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.855
Better hurry.

00:15:06.063 --> 00:15:07.188
Kyojin.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.480
What was that about? Who's Gentosai?

00:15:10.563 --> 00:15:14.938
Shinnosuke, there are some things
you're better off not knowing.

00:15:15.021 --> 00:15:16.105
But--

00:15:18.813 --> 00:15:24.480
Since we're in it, we might as well enjoy
this game they call the Kodoku.

00:16:12.855 --> 00:16:19.271
The eighth of the Kyohachi-ryu successors,
Iroha Kinugasa.

00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:22.396
I found you.

00:16:25.646 --> 00:16:26.688
It can't be…

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.813
All right. Let's get started.

00:16:50.896 --> 00:16:52.105
Right!

00:16:53.188 --> 00:16:54.063
Here we go!

00:17:50.771 --> 00:17:52.521
Found you.

00:17:55.938 --> 00:17:57.021
Kokushu!

00:18:04.105 --> 00:18:06.563
It's about time we settled this!

00:18:10.771 --> 00:18:13.271
Get back!

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.646
I knew it.

00:18:28.313 --> 00:18:31.063
Nothing beats fighting you to the death.

00:18:31.813 --> 00:18:34.021
You only kill for the thrill of it.

00:18:34.105 --> 00:18:36.063
Look who's talking.

00:18:37.188 --> 00:18:38.688
It's pathetic.

00:18:39.438 --> 00:18:41.480
Everything is so pathetic!

00:18:44.021 --> 00:18:46.938
And I'll destroy it all!

00:18:47.438 --> 00:18:48.771
Stop it!

00:18:55.355 --> 00:18:56.813
What's that, little miss?

00:18:58.563 --> 00:19:01.146
Why do you kill innocent people?

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.563
You're no samurai!

00:19:03.646 --> 00:19:04.938
Futaba! Stay back!

00:19:07.188 --> 00:19:08.730
Then what is a samurai?

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:15.396
Answer me that,

00:19:16.271 --> 00:19:17.271
little miss.

00:19:19.021 --> 00:19:21.021
Don't, Bukotsu. Let her go.

00:19:22.646 --> 00:19:24.521
If I killed this girl,

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.938
I reckon you'd fight me then.

00:19:28.021 --> 00:19:29.688
No. Don't do it.

00:19:30.188 --> 00:19:31.230
Don't do it!

00:21:00.605 --> 00:21:02.188
Move it!

00:21:03.688 --> 00:21:04.688
Take that!

00:21:16.855 --> 00:21:18.438
Move! Out of the way!

00:21:36.188 --> 00:21:38.980
You have no chance with that arm.
Just give up.

00:21:40.855 --> 00:21:42.896
You're telling me to give up?

00:21:44.896 --> 00:21:47.438
It's 'cause we gave up
that we ended up this way.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.021
How did it feel to have your sword taken?

00:21:54.188 --> 00:21:56.438
Have you been happy?

00:22:00.355 --> 00:22:01.355
I've been happy.

00:22:01.438 --> 00:22:03.480
Then why are you here?

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:09.896
In the end, the only way you can
prove it to yourself is to kill people.

00:22:12.438 --> 00:22:15.563
You can't even save
a single person without killing, can you?

00:22:21.313 --> 00:22:23.646
The era of the samurai is over?

00:22:24.521 --> 00:22:26.646
I don't give a damn.

00:22:27.146 --> 00:22:28.105
All we have to do

00:22:29.063 --> 00:22:31.271
is build it all over again!

00:22:40.438 --> 00:22:41.646
Move!

00:23:47.563 --> 00:23:49.438
I found you.

00:24:14.313 --> 00:24:15.896
Kokushu!

00:24:21.188 --> 00:24:22.605
Enough of this!

00:24:25.146 --> 00:24:26.521
Take that!

00:24:28.646 --> 00:24:29.688
Run!

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.813
That was a good move.

00:25:19.563 --> 00:25:21.646
But you're done for.

00:25:22.355 --> 00:25:24.646
Any last words?

00:25:27.438 --> 00:25:29.146
If that's all you've got…

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:33.730
you won't be able to defeat my brothers.

00:25:35.563 --> 00:25:36.980
You can rest assured.

00:25:38.063 --> 00:25:41.563
Everything shall soon perish.

00:26:11.355 --> 00:26:15.438
The fourth of the Kyohachi-ryu successors,

00:26:16.146 --> 00:26:18.230
Shikura Adashino.

00:26:37.521 --> 00:26:39.313
I can't believe he dodged that too.

00:26:41.355 --> 00:26:43.605
And now the third,

00:26:45.605 --> 00:26:48.105
Sansuke Gion.

00:27:24.771 --> 00:27:26.271
You monster!

00:27:42.438 --> 00:27:43.480
Sansuke.

00:27:44.938 --> 00:27:45.980
In time with me.

00:27:46.063 --> 00:27:47.105
Got it.

00:28:00.146 --> 00:28:02.105
He's way too strong.

00:28:04.105 --> 00:28:05.188
Run!

00:28:13.188 --> 00:28:15.271
Iroha! Let's move!

00:29:03.105 --> 00:29:05.063
Move!

00:29:05.771 --> 00:29:06.605
Move!

00:33:45.271 --> 00:33:47.521
Kokushu the Manslayer…

00:33:56.105 --> 00:33:57.605
I am…

00:34:00.438 --> 00:34:02.813
happy.

00:34:24.813 --> 00:34:25.938
Shujiro!

00:34:27.063 --> 00:34:29.813
Shujiro!

00:35:22.813 --> 00:35:25.021
The first participant
to reach Chiryu-juku was…

00:35:27.563 --> 00:35:30.188
number 277, Kamuykocha.

00:35:31.896 --> 00:35:34.605
Yes! Splendid!

00:35:34.688 --> 00:35:36.855
His long trip from Ezo was worth it.

00:35:37.438 --> 00:35:41.021
And number 66, Bukotsu Kanjiya,
has been eliminated.

00:35:41.105 --> 00:35:44.188
-What did you say?
-Killed by number 108, Shujiro Saga.

00:35:44.271 --> 00:35:46.938
Well, well.
That's Kokushu the Manslayer for you.

00:35:47.021 --> 00:35:49.771
It's a shame to lose
Bukotsu the Savage Slasher.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.688
It only means that
yet another specter has vanished.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.563
For us, it's something to celebrate.

00:36:00.813 --> 00:36:01.771
I agree.

00:36:01.855 --> 00:36:02.813
Of course.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:06.438
Organizer. It's almost time.

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:16.438
I have duties to attend to,
so I shall be taking my leave for now.

00:36:16.938 --> 00:36:19.313
Of course.
The Superintendent General is a busy man.

00:36:19.396 --> 00:36:20.438
So,

00:36:21.313 --> 00:36:22.396
the time has come.

00:36:24.605 --> 00:36:28.563
I hope you continue to enjoy
the Kodoku, gentlemen.

00:36:49.188 --> 00:36:52.021
I've already telegrammed them
the meeting place.

00:36:52.813 --> 00:36:55.855
Good. Keep the rich bastards entertained.

00:36:55.938 --> 00:36:57.313
Understood, sir.

00:37:12.521 --> 00:37:13.396
Come in.

00:37:14.771 --> 00:37:15.896
Excuse me, sir.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.730
It seems Kawaji returned from
his business trip a little while ago.

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.646
I'll go see him right away.
Get the carriage ready.

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:26.730
Yes, sir.

00:37:26.813 --> 00:37:29.063
You still can't get hold of Shinpei?

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:33.730
No, sir. I sent someone to his home,
but he didn't seem to be back yet.

00:37:33.813 --> 00:37:36.146
Should we ask the police
to conduct a search?

00:37:38.271 --> 00:37:42.855
No. Have the Home Ministry staff members
split up and try to find him.

00:37:43.355 --> 00:37:44.355
Yes, sir.

00:38:36.646 --> 00:38:37.855
What are you--

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:53.105
It's been a long time, Lord Okubo.

00:38:55.521 --> 00:38:59.938
Hanjiro! You're… alive?

00:39:00.771 --> 00:39:02.438
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

00:39:02.521 --> 00:39:05.105
but Kawaji is not headed this way.

00:39:08.688 --> 00:39:09.771
What do you mean?

00:39:09.855 --> 00:39:13.813
I have a message from him instead.

00:39:15.021 --> 00:39:16.230
"Farewell."

00:40:09.896 --> 00:40:11.021
What is…?

00:40:12.896 --> 00:40:15.271
Just what is going on?

00:40:18.563 --> 00:40:21.688
OKAZAKI-JUKU

00:40:25.105 --> 00:40:28.438
Where do you think Iroha went off to?

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:31.021
Knowing her, she'll be just fine.

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:34.688
Extra!

00:40:34.771 --> 00:40:37.271
Extra!

00:40:37.771 --> 00:40:38.938
Extra!

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:43.271
Extra!

00:40:44.688 --> 00:40:46.605
Shujiro, this is…

00:40:47.896 --> 00:40:49.563
Lord Okubo was killed?

00:40:51.688 --> 00:40:53.480
But why?

00:40:56.438 --> 00:40:58.105
This is no coincidence.

00:40:59.563 --> 00:41:00.646
What?

00:41:02.146 --> 00:41:03.938
The Kodoku's involved with this.

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:08.646
Are you Mr. Saga?

00:41:10.646 --> 00:41:11.730
Who's asking?

00:41:11.813 --> 00:41:13.355
A message from Mr. Maejima.

00:41:13.438 --> 00:41:16.730
"I am returning to Tokyo for an emergency.
Keep heading for Tokyo."

00:41:16.813 --> 00:41:18.188
That's all.

00:41:20.813 --> 00:41:21.896
Understood.

00:41:22.396 --> 00:41:23.605
Goodbye, then.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:28.563
Futaba.

00:41:31.063 --> 00:41:33.188
We'll get to Tokyo as fast as we can.

00:41:35.521 --> 00:41:36.605
All right.

00:41:43.813 --> 00:41:45.855
Look out! A carriage is coming!

00:42:35.146 --> 00:42:37.563
Don't move too much.
It'll open up the wound.

00:42:38.896 --> 00:42:39.980
Thanks.

00:42:51.313 --> 00:42:52.896
Hey, you two.

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:57.855
I just had a dream.

00:43:00.646 --> 00:43:03.105
About when we all lived together.

00:43:05.438 --> 00:43:09.355
Sansuke and I were bickering
like we always did.

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:13.646
Shikura-nii was strong.

00:43:15.438 --> 00:43:17.855
We all used to smile back then.

00:43:20.688 --> 00:43:21.730
Yeah.

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:24.146
We sure did.

00:43:26.396 --> 00:43:28.980
If we had the succession match back then…

00:43:31.355 --> 00:43:33.063
I'd be dead.

00:43:39.563 --> 00:43:41.813
It's thanks to Shu-nii running away…

00:43:47.188 --> 00:43:49.271
that I'm still alive now.

00:43:56.313 --> 00:43:58.813
But until we defeat Gentosai…

00:44:01.355 --> 00:44:03.521
we can't move forward.

00:44:16.646 --> 00:44:18.396
We'll take him down,

00:44:19.938 --> 00:44:21.688
all of us siblings together.

00:44:24.396 --> 00:44:25.480
That bastard…

00:44:28.063 --> 00:44:30.438
We can't beat him
unless we're all together.

00:44:36.771 --> 00:44:37.855
You're right.

00:44:39.521 --> 00:44:40.813
We just gotta do it.

00:44:41.855 --> 00:44:42.688
Yeah.

00:44:43.521 --> 00:44:46.146
Let's start by getting
all the siblings together.

00:45:03.105 --> 00:45:04.646
At Shimizudani in Kioi-cho…

00:45:05.146 --> 00:45:06.396
He actually did it!

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.938
Organizer is truly a formidable man.

00:45:09.021 --> 00:45:11.938
This will allow us to focus on the Kodoku.

00:45:12.021 --> 00:45:12.980
Indeed.

00:45:13.563 --> 00:45:16.396
We still have
many remarkable participants left.

00:45:16.896 --> 00:45:18.813
The weak ones are gone.

00:45:18.896 --> 00:45:21.521
Only the strong remain now.

00:45:32.313 --> 00:45:34.563
CHIRYU, OKAZAKI, HAMAMATSU, SHIMADA

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:38.438
Well, gentlemen.

00:45:38.938 --> 00:45:41.855
I hope you continue to enjoy the Kodoku.

00:45:43.271 --> 00:45:44.688
Cheers.

00:45:44.771 --> 00:45:45.813
-Wait for me.
-Run!

00:45:46.396 --> 00:45:47.396
He's right behind us!

00:45:51.105 --> 00:45:52.730
Let's play some more.

00:45:57.355 --> 00:45:58.896
Well, lucky me.

00:45:59.396 --> 00:46:01.230
I was short on tags.

00:46:09.896 --> 00:46:10.896
Good.

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:12.438
That should be enough.

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:17.105
You wanna fight too, sir?

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:20.480
Come on, why not?

00:46:20.563 --> 00:46:22.063
It's fun.

00:46:49.355 --> 00:46:51.730
Really? You couldn't kill them?

00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:54.063
I even gave you their location.

00:47:08.938 --> 00:47:12.355
Keep killing each other
until only one is left standing.

00:47:37.855 --> 00:47:40.771
LAST SAMURAI STANDING

00:47:40.855 --> 00:47:43.521
END OF CHAPTER ONE

00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:31.730
