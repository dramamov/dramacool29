(Jiao Tong Pavilion)

00:02:08.122 --> 00:02:10.241
Why does everything
require spirit stones?

00:02:10.402 --> 00:02:11.241
Madam, please.

00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:11.882
Please.

00:02:15.162 --> 00:02:17.042
I still think that one's better.

00:02:17.322 --> 00:02:18.402
Truly nice.

00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:21.122
Look, that one's good.

00:02:30.961 --> 00:02:33.122
How could there be a barrier here?

00:02:33.521 --> 00:02:35.681
It seems it's the real Jiao Tong.

00:02:36.921 --> 00:02:38.081
Jiao Tong,

00:02:38.081 --> 00:02:39.402
I'm here to meet you.

00:02:39.521 --> 00:02:40.722
Please open the door.

00:02:42.122 --> 00:02:42.961
Come in.

00:03:09.801 --> 00:03:11.081
Jiao Tong?

00:03:14.042 --> 00:03:15.241
Jiao Tong?

00:03:23.122 --> 00:03:24.241
Jiao Tong,

00:03:24.361 --> 00:03:26.081
haven't you got up yet?

00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:29.042
Come in, Madam.

00:03:30.842 --> 00:03:31.722
Perhaps

00:03:31.722 --> 00:03:33.921
you should put some clothes on first.

00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:36.562
Catching cold would be unfortunate.

00:03:38.481 --> 00:03:39.882
How intriguing.

00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:06.442
Madam.

00:04:09.722 --> 00:04:11.562
Jiao Tong?

00:04:13.761 --> 00:04:15.602
You're really young and accomplished.

00:04:16.202 --> 00:04:17.321
Despite your youth,

00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:19.202
you visit Jiao Tong Pavilion

00:04:19.402 --> 00:04:20.762
with such lavish generosity.

00:04:21.282 --> 00:04:22.962
It's truly my honor.

00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:24.321
No, no.

00:04:24.402 --> 00:04:25.962
The honor is entirely mine.

00:04:26.082 --> 00:04:27.361
But Jiao Tong,

00:04:27.441 --> 00:04:29.522
please just call me Kong Hou.

00:04:29.522 --> 00:04:31.441
I'm not a Madam.

00:04:31.642 --> 00:04:32.722
I obtained this token

00:04:32.762 --> 00:04:33.681
from a lady

00:04:33.722 --> 00:04:34.602
in exchange.

00:04:34.762 --> 00:04:36.282
I merely assisted her briefly,

00:04:36.441 --> 00:04:37.241
and she gifted me

00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:38.042
this token.

00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:39.481
I see.

00:04:40.082 --> 00:04:41.121
It matters not.

00:04:41.241 --> 00:04:42.681
All visitors are welcome guests.

00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:45.082
I shall ensure

00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:46.361
you leave fully satisfied.

00:04:47.402 --> 00:04:48.921
Well, actually,

00:04:49.042 --> 00:04:50.722
I came

00:04:50.881 --> 00:04:52.202
to ask for your help.

00:04:52.282 --> 00:04:53.001
No rush.

00:04:53.121 --> 00:04:54.602
We have plenty of time.

00:04:54.722 --> 00:04:55.801
Let us sit

00:04:56.522 --> 00:04:57.522
and discuss in detail.

00:04:58.762 --> 00:04:59.402
Okay.

00:05:01.042 --> 00:05:02.602
Finest qin master in the land?

00:05:02.762 --> 00:05:04.522
Jiao Tong Pavilion seems ordinary to me.

00:05:04.642 --> 00:05:05.722
Good thing you didn't go.

00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:06.241
Who knows

00:05:06.241 --> 00:05:07.241
what would've happened.

00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:08.001
Why say that

00:05:08.042 --> 00:05:08.962
at such a time?

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:09.921
Don't worry.

00:05:09.921 --> 00:05:10.881
Kong Hou will be fine.

00:05:10.881 --> 00:05:11.762
With her quick wit,

00:05:11.762 --> 00:05:12.561
you needn't worry.

00:05:13.921 --> 00:05:15.522
A toast to you first.

00:05:15.642 --> 00:05:18.241
May you retain your youth forever

00:05:18.361 --> 00:05:19.602
and have endless good fortune.

00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:30.762
Your skin

00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:33.282
is so soft and flawless.

00:05:33.681 --> 00:05:35.842
It's really enviable.

00:05:35.962 --> 00:05:36.642
Right?

00:05:36.762 --> 00:05:38.082
This snow cream was crafted

00:05:38.082 --> 00:05:39.361
by Senior Ling Hui.

00:05:39.481 --> 00:05:40.881
Jiao Tong, do you like it?

00:05:40.881 --> 00:05:42.361
Shall I give you some?

00:05:42.481 --> 00:05:43.121
I've brought it.

00:05:43.202 --> 00:05:44.642
But what I desire

00:05:46.361 --> 00:05:49.561
may not be just the snow cream.

00:05:51.962 --> 00:05:52.962
And...

00:05:58.402 --> 00:05:59.602
Jiao Tong,

00:05:59.681 --> 00:06:00.801
what do you like?

00:06:00.881 --> 00:06:02.921
I've brought various delicacies

00:06:03.001 --> 00:06:04.121
and entertainments galore.

00:06:04.121 --> 00:06:05.441
I'll get you one of everything.

00:06:05.602 --> 00:06:07.121
Your generosity shines bright.

00:06:07.241 --> 00:06:08.202
However,

00:06:08.282 --> 00:06:09.801
as you've come seeking diversion here,

00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:10.881
it's only proper

00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:12.801
I ensure your complete satisfaction.

00:06:13.001 --> 00:06:16.042
How could I accept your gifts?

00:06:18.522 --> 00:06:20.681
Come on. Another toast to you.

00:06:29.202 --> 00:06:30.522
You just mentioned

00:06:30.602 --> 00:06:31.962
you came to ask for my help.

00:06:32.602 --> 00:06:33.842
What is it?

00:06:34.321 --> 00:06:35.402
Here's the thing.

00:06:40.561 --> 00:06:41.962
This is my natal spiritual tool,

00:06:42.082 --> 00:06:43.121
phoenix-headed konghou.

00:06:43.241 --> 00:06:43.962
Yet regrettably,

00:06:44.042 --> 00:06:45.402
I still can't make it resonate.

00:06:45.522 --> 00:06:46.522
I heard you are

00:06:46.522 --> 00:06:47.881
a master of musical arts.

00:06:48.001 --> 00:06:48.801
So

00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:49.921
I want to ask for your help.

00:06:49.921 --> 00:06:50.801
Please

00:06:50.842 --> 00:06:51.881
instruct me.

00:06:54.042 --> 00:06:55.241
Please.

00:06:57.602 --> 00:07:00.402
My expertise lies
in the scorched-tail guqin.

00:07:01.162 --> 00:07:03.162
As for phoenix-headed konghou...

00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:07.481
You don't know

00:07:07.602 --> 00:07:09.561
how to play the konghou?

00:07:13.801 --> 00:07:14.842
Not exactly.

00:07:14.962 --> 00:07:17.722
I have some basic knowledge
of the konghou.

00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:21.522
You scared me.

00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:23.001
That's perfect then!

00:07:24.681 --> 00:07:28.082
To awaken your natal spiritual tool,

00:07:28.162 --> 00:07:30.762
spiritual resonance is crucial,

00:07:31.321 --> 00:07:32.441
but first and foremost,

00:07:32.602 --> 00:07:35.082
your musical skills must be proficient.

00:07:35.962 --> 00:07:37.321
Musical skills...

00:07:38.202 --> 00:07:39.241
I'll teach you.

00:07:40.881 --> 00:07:42.962
Come on.

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:49.762
Come.

00:07:51.202 --> 00:07:52.481
Let's try.

00:08:02.282 --> 00:08:05.042
Your slender fingers

00:08:05.202 --> 00:08:06.762
with rounded fingertips

00:08:07.282 --> 00:08:11.001
are perfect for plucking the strings.

00:08:12.282 --> 00:08:13.202
No need to rush.

00:08:18.642 --> 00:08:19.801
Take your time.

00:08:22.722 --> 00:08:23.642
Second,

00:08:23.801 --> 00:08:25.561
if no one else is around

00:08:25.681 --> 00:08:27.082
and you are with Jiao Tong

00:08:27.082 --> 00:08:28.241
in a room alone,

00:08:28.361 --> 00:08:30.441
don't let him get close to you.

00:08:36.921 --> 00:08:39.042
Well, Jiao Tong.

00:08:39.201 --> 00:08:40.561
Maybe you demonstrate first?

00:08:40.681 --> 00:08:42.321
I'll observe from here.

00:08:45.242 --> 00:08:46.122
Very well.

00:09:08.561 --> 00:09:11.321
Though your konghou is exquisite,

00:09:11.601 --> 00:09:13.002
as this is my first attempt,

00:09:13.122 --> 00:09:14.441
some adjustments may be needed.

00:09:15.002 --> 00:09:17.642
Why not wait a moment,

00:09:17.762 --> 00:09:20.002
and let me fetch my personal instrument?

00:09:20.321 --> 00:09:21.122
Okay.

00:09:31.561 --> 00:09:33.081
That really scared me.

00:09:33.681 --> 00:09:35.321
This man

00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:37.721
acts so strangely.

00:09:38.081 --> 00:09:39.561
It's just playing qin,

00:09:39.642 --> 00:09:42.362
yet he keeps breathing near my ear.

00:09:42.721 --> 00:09:45.042
Is there something wrong with him?

00:09:50.441 --> 00:09:51.242
My lady,

00:09:51.362 --> 00:09:52.762
I'm truly sorry.

00:09:52.882 --> 00:09:53.961
I forgot

00:09:54.122 --> 00:09:54.882
that yesterday

00:09:54.882 --> 00:09:56.122
I lent my konghou

00:09:56.122 --> 00:09:57.681
to Xi Tang.

00:09:58.162 --> 00:09:58.841
Then

00:09:58.961 --> 00:10:00.482
let's go find him now.

00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:03.042
Xi Tang isn't in Yi City today.

00:10:03.362 --> 00:10:04.681
He'll return tomorrow.

00:10:04.961 --> 00:10:05.961
Perhaps

00:10:06.122 --> 00:10:07.242
you could

00:10:07.362 --> 00:10:09.002
stay here tonight,

00:10:09.122 --> 00:10:10.921
and I'll personally instruct you

00:10:11.042 --> 00:10:12.282
after their return tomorrow.

00:10:12.402 --> 00:10:13.482
No need, really.

00:10:13.601 --> 00:10:15.242
I'll come tomorrow then.

00:10:15.362 --> 00:10:16.081
That's fine.

00:10:16.762 --> 00:10:18.601
Then I'm sorry.

00:10:26.762 --> 00:10:27.801
To express my regret,

00:10:27.921 --> 00:10:29.482
allow me to offer another toast to you.

00:10:30.482 --> 00:10:32.642
No need for formalities.

00:10:33.482 --> 00:10:34.402
Cheers.

00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:52.482
My lady,

00:10:52.601 --> 00:10:55.402
please try Yi City's specialties.

00:10:55.522 --> 00:10:56.522
Now that you mention it,

00:10:56.522 --> 00:10:57.642
I won't be polite.

00:10:57.762 --> 00:10:59.961
I am rather hungry now.

00:11:02.441 --> 00:11:04.242
This is our honey lotus root.

00:11:08.402 --> 00:11:09.482
(What's wrong?)

00:11:10.162 --> 00:11:11.441
(The spiritual infusion)

00:11:11.441 --> 00:11:12.841
(should have taken effect by now.)

00:11:13.081 --> 00:11:14.282
(But she...)

00:11:15.321 --> 00:11:17.042
(Was the dosage insufficient?)

00:11:27.882 --> 00:11:29.402
Meeting you has been

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:30.642
a most fortunate encounter.

00:11:31.201 --> 00:11:32.841
Another toast to you!

00:11:35.801 --> 00:11:37.441
Once you leave your cup,

00:11:37.482 --> 00:11:38.721
don't drink from it again.

00:11:40.002 --> 00:11:41.002
Jiao Tong,

00:11:41.081 --> 00:11:42.002
why do I suddenly feel

00:11:42.002 --> 00:11:43.122
so cold?

00:11:43.921 --> 00:11:45.482
What's causing this?

00:11:45.522 --> 00:11:46.561
Is there a draft here?

00:11:49.482 --> 00:11:51.042
My deepest apologies for this lapse.

00:11:51.162 --> 00:11:52.362
Please wait a moment.

00:11:59.162 --> 00:12:00.081
(I would like to see)

00:12:00.081 --> 00:12:01.321
(if Huan Zong was right.)

00:12:01.561 --> 00:12:03.002
(If you really dared to poison me,)

00:12:03.081 --> 00:12:04.362
(you'll pay for this.)

00:12:09.042 --> 00:12:10.762
Come on, Jiao Tong.

00:12:13.402 --> 00:12:14.201
Cheers.

00:12:36.801 --> 00:12:38.441
You drink well.

00:12:39.081 --> 00:12:41.122
How about another cup?

00:12:41.282 --> 00:12:42.561
Sure!

00:13:04.921 --> 00:13:06.282
Huan Zong was right.

00:13:06.402 --> 00:13:07.841
You're truly suspicious!

00:13:11.482 --> 00:13:12.642
Your face...

00:13:20.002 --> 00:13:21.122
My face...

00:13:21.201 --> 00:13:22.042
Hey, girl!

00:13:23.042 --> 00:13:25.122
It's you!

00:13:26.282 --> 00:13:28.042
You switched the wine cups.

00:13:29.282 --> 00:13:30.762
Why did you poison the wine?

00:13:30.801 --> 00:13:31.961
What do you want?

00:13:32.961 --> 00:13:34.362
What do I want?

00:13:36.122 --> 00:13:37.601
What do I want?

00:13:40.482 --> 00:13:42.642
I'll peel your pretty face off.

00:13:44.961 --> 00:13:45.961
How's that?

00:13:52.201 --> 00:13:53.201
Help!

00:13:59.721 --> 00:14:00.841
Someone, help!

00:14:37.721 --> 00:14:39.642
Let's see how far you can get!

00:14:42.042 --> 00:14:42.681
Stay back!

00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:44.282
Give me back my face!

00:14:49.002 --> 00:14:49.721
Kong Hou,

00:14:50.321 --> 00:14:51.042
how are you?

00:14:54.282 --> 00:14:56.002
Huan Zong, I'm fine.

00:14:56.882 --> 00:14:58.601
Look, Jiao Tong.

00:14:58.601 --> 00:14:59.522
Look at his face.

00:14:59.681 --> 00:15:01.002
He attacked me just now.

00:15:01.002 --> 00:15:01.841
It was him!

00:15:03.522 --> 00:15:04.801
Let me take you back first.

00:15:05.201 --> 00:15:06.321
Lin Hu will deal with him.

00:15:06.561 --> 00:15:07.162
Let's go.

00:15:11.482 --> 00:15:12.642
Got it. Leave him to me.

00:15:25.882 --> 00:15:26.762
No.

00:15:27.122 --> 00:15:28.642
Just now, Jiao Tong's face

00:15:28.721 --> 00:15:29.961
was about to split open.

00:15:30.002 --> 00:15:31.282
I must go back and see

00:15:31.282 --> 00:15:32.482
what he truly looks like.

00:15:33.002 --> 00:15:33.882
No.

00:15:35.002 --> 00:15:37.081
W-Why?

00:15:40.362 --> 00:15:41.522
Because...

00:15:41.762 --> 00:15:43.162
I'm injured.

00:15:43.882 --> 00:15:44.961
Where are you injured?

00:15:44.961 --> 00:15:45.921
Show me.

00:15:45.961 --> 00:15:46.762
Are you okay?

00:15:46.801 --> 00:15:47.522
Maybe it's because

00:15:47.522 --> 00:15:49.362
I used spiritual energy earlier.

00:15:49.681 --> 00:15:50.882
My chest hurts.

00:15:50.882 --> 00:15:51.642
Chest?

00:15:51.642 --> 00:15:52.561
My leg also aches.

00:15:52.561 --> 00:15:53.441
Leg?

00:15:53.441 --> 00:15:54.561
My head feels fuzzy.

00:15:54.642 --> 00:15:55.561
What should we do?

00:15:55.561 --> 00:15:57.482
Then maybe we should go back first?

00:15:58.882 --> 00:15:59.642
Let's go back.

00:15:59.762 --> 00:16:00.642
Help me up, please?

00:16:00.642 --> 00:16:01.441
Okay.

00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:02.362
My head...

00:16:02.482 --> 00:16:03.162
Slowly.

00:16:03.162 --> 00:16:04.482
I was fine earlier.

00:16:06.721 --> 00:16:08.122
So you're Jiao Tong?

00:16:08.362 --> 00:16:09.242
Turn your head.

00:16:09.601 --> 00:16:10.561
Let me see

00:16:10.561 --> 00:16:11.961
how handsome you really are.

00:16:32.801 --> 00:16:33.601
It's you?

00:16:36.362 --> 00:16:37.482
How could it be you?

00:16:51.681 --> 00:16:52.721
I never imagined

00:16:53.282 --> 00:16:54.801
we'd meet again

00:16:56.162 --> 00:16:57.681
like this.

00:16:58.681 --> 00:16:59.321
You...

00:17:00.362 --> 00:17:01.841
Why are you still doing this?

00:17:07.522 --> 00:17:08.242
So

00:17:10.962 --> 00:17:12.242
you will kill me?

00:17:26.282 --> 00:17:27.242
Huan Zong.

00:17:28.121 --> 00:17:29.682
Huan Zong, are you alright?

00:17:30.361 --> 00:17:31.042
Huan Zong,

00:17:31.202 --> 00:17:32.361
you used spiritual energy

00:17:32.361 --> 00:17:33.161
just now, right?

00:17:33.161 --> 00:17:34.482
Should I regulate your energy?

00:17:35.682 --> 00:17:36.522
It's fine.

00:17:37.282 --> 00:17:38.601
Just some energy blockage.

00:17:38.881 --> 00:17:40.002
What should we do?

00:17:43.682 --> 00:17:44.641
Maybe

00:17:45.522 --> 00:17:46.722
pat my back?

00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:48.682
Okay, I'll try.

00:17:48.762 --> 00:17:49.762
Come, sit.

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:11.482
Does this feel better?

00:18:13.042 --> 00:18:14.002
Much better.

00:18:19.841 --> 00:18:20.682
Kong Hou,

00:18:24.081 --> 00:18:24.922
I shouldn't have

00:18:24.922 --> 00:18:26.202
let you go alone today.

00:18:27.202 --> 00:18:28.722
It was not your fault.

00:18:28.762 --> 00:18:29.442
Besides,

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:30.841
if you hadn't warned me

00:18:30.841 --> 00:18:32.121
in advance,

00:18:32.242 --> 00:18:33.641
I might have fallen for it.

00:18:33.801 --> 00:18:35.042
You have no idea

00:18:35.121 --> 00:18:36.601
how Jiao Tong acted.

00:18:36.722 --> 00:18:38.242
After downing a cup of wine,

00:18:38.361 --> 00:18:40.282
his entire face started peeling off.

00:18:40.401 --> 00:18:41.561
That scared me half to death.

00:18:42.881 --> 00:18:44.321
That's not what I meant.

00:18:55.962 --> 00:18:57.202
I mean

00:18:57.321 --> 00:18:58.762
I won't let you...

00:19:11.202 --> 00:19:12.442
I mean

00:19:12.561 --> 00:19:13.321
from now on,

00:19:13.482 --> 00:19:15.442
you mustn't stay alone
in a room with any man.

00:19:15.561 --> 00:19:16.641
Even if you do,

00:19:16.801 --> 00:19:18.561
never let him get close to you.

00:19:18.722 --> 00:19:19.482
Understand?

00:19:20.081 --> 00:19:21.121
But right now,

00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:22.682
aren't we sharing this very room?

00:19:23.361 --> 00:19:24.762
Are you saying

00:19:24.841 --> 00:19:26.361
this shouldn't be allowed, either?

00:19:34.321 --> 00:19:35.722
I see now.

00:19:36.202 --> 00:19:37.401
I'll follow your instructions

00:19:37.401 --> 00:19:38.482
in the future.

00:19:38.641 --> 00:19:40.081
If I must be alone

00:19:40.081 --> 00:19:41.321
with a man,

00:19:41.321 --> 00:19:42.922
I'll maintain proper distance.

00:19:43.442 --> 00:19:44.722
We're different.

00:19:45.242 --> 00:19:47.762
How are we any different?

00:19:49.442 --> 00:19:50.242
It's just...

00:19:53.962 --> 00:19:55.121
Just different.

00:20:00.042 --> 00:20:01.042
Huan Zong,

00:20:01.121 --> 00:20:02.482
I was teasing you.

00:20:02.601 --> 00:20:03.161
We

00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:04.801
are very, very good friends.

00:20:04.841 --> 00:20:06.401
Of course, we can stay together.

00:20:06.561 --> 00:20:07.321
Moreover,

00:20:07.401 --> 00:20:08.561
whenever

00:20:08.561 --> 00:20:09.801
I'm with you,

00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:11.561
I feel completely at ease.

00:20:16.922 --> 00:20:17.841
We

00:20:18.841 --> 00:20:20.601
are just good friends?

00:20:26.522 --> 00:20:27.442
Huan Zong.

00:20:29.482 --> 00:20:30.321
Huan Zong?

00:20:32.282 --> 00:20:34.762
Why is your face so red?

00:20:42.321 --> 00:20:44.442
Are you angry

00:20:44.722 --> 00:20:46.242
because I teased you just now?

00:20:48.242 --> 00:20:48.962
No.

00:20:49.242 --> 00:20:50.002
Then why

00:20:50.002 --> 00:20:51.401
is your face so flushed?

00:20:53.361 --> 00:20:54.881
I won't joke with you anymore,

00:20:54.881 --> 00:20:55.801
is that better?

00:21:11.034 --> 00:21:13.498
(Jiao Tong Pavilion)

00:21:16.202 --> 00:21:16.762
Who's there?

00:21:16.962 --> 00:21:17.641
Show yourself!

00:21:18.401 --> 00:21:19.321
Don't kill me.

00:21:19.561 --> 00:21:20.242
Don't kill me.

00:21:20.881 --> 00:21:22.242
I'm just a servant here.

00:21:27.682 --> 00:21:28.561
I won't kill you.

00:21:29.361 --> 00:21:30.361
What happened here?

00:21:30.561 --> 00:21:31.361
Just now,

00:21:31.482 --> 00:21:32.401
Jiao Tong

00:21:32.401 --> 00:21:33.522
fought with someone.

00:21:33.962 --> 00:21:35.361
His face was terrifying,

00:21:35.762 --> 00:21:37.002
all peeling off.

00:21:37.321 --> 00:21:39.202
I never thought he'd harm people.

00:21:39.401 --> 00:21:40.922
He even took that lady.

00:21:40.962 --> 00:21:41.722
Lady?

00:21:41.962 --> 00:21:42.881
Where was she taken?

00:21:43.401 --> 00:21:45.482
Two young masters

00:21:45.922 --> 00:21:47.161
saved her.

00:21:47.202 --> 00:21:48.121
What about Jiao Tong?

00:21:48.801 --> 00:21:49.522
I don't know.

00:21:49.522 --> 00:21:50.641
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:21:51.081 --> 00:21:52.841
I truly know nothing anyway.

00:21:53.002 --> 00:21:54.962
It was the newly arrived young master

00:21:54.962 --> 00:21:55.841
who let him escape.

00:21:55.881 --> 00:21:56.922
Let him escape?

00:22:11.282 --> 00:22:12.561
Stop pacing.

00:22:12.841 --> 00:22:14.601
Jiao Tong's nothing special.

00:22:14.601 --> 00:22:15.841
Lin Hu can handle him.

00:22:16.442 --> 00:22:18.282
Then why isn't he back yet?

00:22:18.881 --> 00:22:20.081
Sit down for a game.

00:22:20.202 --> 00:22:21.361
Wait for him calmly.

00:22:22.561 --> 00:22:23.282
Fine.

00:22:23.801 --> 00:22:26.002
I'll show you how to lose.

00:22:42.682 --> 00:22:43.801
Your way of playing

00:22:43.801 --> 00:22:45.002
is rather unique.

00:22:45.442 --> 00:22:46.482
Of course.

00:22:50.522 --> 00:22:51.081
Okay.

00:22:51.121 --> 00:22:52.601
Huan Zong, I've won.

00:22:59.282 --> 00:23:00.962
How's this a win?

00:23:01.282 --> 00:23:02.841
One, two, three, four, five.

00:23:02.841 --> 00:23:03.762
Five in a row.

00:23:03.762 --> 00:23:04.922
This means I win.

00:23:05.522 --> 00:23:06.682
Aren't we playing Go?

00:23:06.762 --> 00:23:08.442
You didn't specify earlier.

00:23:12.042 --> 00:23:12.922
Cheating, are you?

00:23:13.081 --> 00:23:14.282
I won't stoop to your level.

00:23:16.242 --> 00:23:17.682
You accuse me of cheating,

00:23:17.722 --> 00:23:18.682
yet you never mentioned

00:23:18.682 --> 00:23:19.601
that I didn't blame you

00:23:19.601 --> 00:23:20.482
for not telling me

00:23:20.482 --> 00:23:21.881
you are Master Writer.

00:23:22.881 --> 00:23:23.522
What's there

00:23:23.522 --> 00:23:24.722
to hide about?

00:23:24.762 --> 00:23:26.482
You are Master Writer,

00:23:26.641 --> 00:23:29.121
such a brilliant storybook writer.

00:23:30.002 --> 00:23:30.922
Brilliant?

00:23:32.002 --> 00:23:33.321
Except for you,

00:23:33.482 --> 00:23:35.242
no one reads my books anyway.

00:23:36.641 --> 00:23:37.641
I get it.

00:23:37.762 --> 00:23:39.321
So you kept it from me

00:23:39.321 --> 00:23:40.641
because no one buys your books,

00:23:40.641 --> 00:23:41.601
and you

00:23:41.722 --> 00:23:42.962
feel ashamed,

00:23:42.962 --> 00:23:43.641
right?

00:23:45.962 --> 00:23:46.682
Young Master.

00:23:48.401 --> 00:23:50.042
Lin Hu, you're back.

00:23:51.641 --> 00:23:52.482
Young Master.

00:23:52.601 --> 00:23:53.722
It has been settled.

00:23:54.002 --> 00:23:54.682
Considering

00:23:54.682 --> 00:23:55.641
we're both foxes,

00:23:55.801 --> 00:23:57.202
please leave its corpse intact.

00:23:57.482 --> 00:23:58.321
Foxes?

00:23:58.401 --> 00:24:00.361
So Lin Hu, you're a demon cultivator?

00:24:00.962 --> 00:24:01.801
What's wrong?

00:24:01.962 --> 00:24:03.522
You won't be like those people

00:24:03.561 --> 00:24:05.161
who would harm demon cultivators, right?

00:24:05.401 --> 00:24:06.682
What did they do?

00:24:06.881 --> 00:24:07.762
Holding prejudice?

00:24:09.282 --> 00:24:10.722
Demon and human cultivators,

00:24:10.722 --> 00:24:11.922
as long as they're righteous,

00:24:11.962 --> 00:24:12.841
to me,

00:24:12.841 --> 00:24:14.042
they're all the same.

00:24:14.202 --> 00:24:15.002
Besides,

00:24:15.042 --> 00:24:16.801
demon cultivation
is extremely difficult.

00:24:16.841 --> 00:24:18.682
So, it's impressive.

00:24:18.841 --> 00:24:19.482
Really?

00:24:20.922 --> 00:24:21.881
Thank you.

00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:22.762
But

00:24:22.881 --> 00:24:24.522
since you're a demon cultivator,

00:24:24.682 --> 00:24:25.601
how did you

00:24:25.601 --> 00:24:26.922
know Huan Zong?

00:24:27.042 --> 00:24:28.922
Isn't Liuguang Sect...

00:24:29.161 --> 00:24:30.242
That's enough.

00:24:30.242 --> 00:24:31.361
Why so many questions?

00:24:31.641 --> 00:24:33.002
Master Zong, I'll take my leave.

00:25:10.962 --> 00:25:12.482
You're truly hideous-looking.

00:25:13.202 --> 00:25:14.161
Who said that?

00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:36.641
How are you improving

00:25:36.641 --> 00:25:37.522
so quickly now?

00:25:39.561 --> 00:25:41.042
You are just too inept.

00:25:42.161 --> 00:25:43.881
You've secretly learned
from Master, right?

00:25:44.081 --> 00:25:44.682
No.

00:25:45.722 --> 00:25:46.801
Then that means

00:25:46.841 --> 00:25:48.242
you found your cultivation partner,

00:25:48.242 --> 00:25:48.742
right?

00:25:48.841 --> 00:25:50.321
It's not that easy to find one.

00:25:50.561 --> 00:25:51.361
I merely

00:25:51.361 --> 00:25:52.881
captured a few female cultivators.

00:25:53.361 --> 00:25:54.841
The dual cultivation

00:25:55.002 --> 00:25:56.321
is actually quite fascinating.

00:25:57.002 --> 00:25:57.641
What?

00:25:58.282 --> 00:25:59.482
Female cultivators?

00:26:00.161 --> 00:26:01.641
What? Angry with me?

00:26:01.682 --> 00:26:03.841
Next time, I'll definitely take you.

00:26:06.401 --> 00:26:07.161
What?

00:26:08.762 --> 00:26:09.801
Female cultivators?

00:26:21.482 --> 00:26:23.081
Actually, what he did wasn't wrong,

00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:23.722
right?

00:26:24.121 --> 00:26:24.762
We've all

00:26:24.762 --> 00:26:26.361
taken human form recently.

00:26:26.641 --> 00:26:27.722
This method

00:26:27.762 --> 00:26:29.042
helps enhance our cultivation.

00:26:29.722 --> 00:26:31.881
I've seen many demon cultivators

00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:32.801
who did the same thing

00:26:32.801 --> 00:26:33.841
to facilitate cultivation.

00:26:34.081 --> 00:26:34.601
I...

00:26:36.161 --> 00:26:38.522
I could do that too, couldn't I?

00:26:44.202 --> 00:26:45.641
Such intense sword energy.

00:27:43.442 --> 00:27:44.682
Why are you copying me?

00:27:46.202 --> 00:27:47.561
I want to be like you.

00:27:49.002 --> 00:27:50.401
You can't be like me.

00:27:50.442 --> 00:27:51.722
You're a demon cultivator.

00:27:52.121 --> 00:27:53.282
What's wrong with that?

00:27:53.321 --> 00:27:54.561
Look down on demon cultivators?

00:27:56.242 --> 00:27:57.762
Even as a demon cultivator,

00:27:57.962 --> 00:27:59.282
you shouldn't casually steal

00:27:59.282 --> 00:28:00.282
others' achievements.

00:28:01.722 --> 00:28:03.401
If you truly want to be like me,

00:28:03.722 --> 00:28:04.881
everything must be achieved

00:28:04.881 --> 00:28:05.881
through your own efforts.

00:28:06.042 --> 00:28:06.801
Understand?

00:28:36.401 --> 00:28:38.401
Lin Hu, where are you?

00:28:38.522 --> 00:28:39.762
Come drink with me.

00:28:43.161 --> 00:28:44.161
Young Master,

00:28:44.601 --> 00:28:45.361
do you have

00:28:45.361 --> 00:28:46.522
anything to say?

00:28:46.841 --> 00:28:47.601
No.

00:28:47.762 --> 00:28:49.641
Just drinking alone
makes me feel lonely.

00:28:49.841 --> 00:28:51.161
I wanted your company.

00:28:53.962 --> 00:28:54.722
I...

00:28:54.722 --> 00:28:55.641
No need to explain.

00:28:55.801 --> 00:28:56.841
I trust you,

00:28:57.242 --> 00:28:59.002
and the cultivation path you've chosen.

00:29:02.881 --> 00:29:04.161
Never mind. Don't come.

00:29:07.522 --> 00:29:09.482
Huan Zong, what are you
doing at this hour?

00:29:11.042 --> 00:29:12.202
Drinking?

00:29:12.401 --> 00:29:14.522
Didn't you say you're fasting
and won't drink?

00:29:15.922 --> 00:29:18.242
Just occasionally.
A small amount won't hurt.

00:29:18.442 --> 00:29:19.762
Then why didn't you invite me?

00:29:19.762 --> 00:29:20.762
I want some too.

00:29:24.841 --> 00:29:26.002
Trust me?

00:29:34.762 --> 00:29:36.081
Useless fool.

00:29:36.242 --> 00:29:37.242
You couldn't even handle

00:29:37.242 --> 00:29:38.121
such a simple task.

00:29:40.682 --> 00:29:42.641
Master, I am incompetent.

00:29:42.801 --> 00:29:44.282
I failed to make proper arrangements.

00:29:44.482 --> 00:29:46.002
But don't worry.

00:29:46.161 --> 00:29:46.881
As long as they

00:29:46.881 --> 00:29:47.841
stay in Yi City,

00:29:47.841 --> 00:29:48.682
they won't escape.

00:29:48.722 --> 00:29:49.682
I humbly request

00:29:49.682 --> 00:29:51.682
that you speak kindly of us
before the Lord.

00:29:52.242 --> 00:29:53.722
Please don't punish us.

00:29:53.962 --> 00:29:54.841
Considering your years

00:29:54.841 --> 00:29:56.762
of devotion to the Lord,

00:29:57.042 --> 00:29:58.641
I'll let this slide.

00:29:58.922 --> 00:30:01.081
But if you fail again...

00:30:01.081 --> 00:30:02.401
I'll accept any punishment.

00:30:14.641 --> 00:30:15.401
Stop.

00:30:17.641 --> 00:30:19.081
You're Jiao Tong?

00:30:19.401 --> 00:30:20.282
Who are you?

00:30:20.641 --> 00:30:22.042
Ling Bo from Zhaohan Sect.

00:30:23.321 --> 00:30:24.561
So you're Lady Ling Bo

00:30:24.561 --> 00:30:25.801
from Zhaohan Sect.

00:30:26.242 --> 00:30:27.361
What do you want from me?

00:30:27.682 --> 00:30:29.202
Why did you capture that lady?

00:30:29.442 --> 00:30:30.401
Lady Ling Bo,

00:30:30.401 --> 00:30:32.321
are you meddling in others' affairs?

00:30:32.801 --> 00:30:34.121
What's this

00:30:34.282 --> 00:30:35.922
got to do with you?

00:30:36.121 --> 00:30:38.042
She belongs to Yunhua Sect.

00:30:38.401 --> 00:30:40.561
How dare you seize someone
from Yunhua Sect?

00:30:40.641 --> 00:30:41.801
What's your real purpose?

00:30:41.922 --> 00:30:42.881
My purpose

00:30:42.881 --> 00:30:44.442
is none of your concern.

00:30:45.282 --> 00:30:47.161
But if you don't leave now,

00:30:47.522 --> 00:30:49.161
even Zhaohan Sect members

00:30:49.801 --> 00:30:51.081
won't be safe from me.

00:30:51.202 --> 00:30:52.202
How dare you!

00:31:00.202 --> 00:31:01.922
I'll come back for you after things

00:31:02.161 --> 00:31:03.242
are settled tomorrow.

00:31:08.361 --> 00:31:09.482
I can't let it go to waste.

00:31:41.682 --> 00:31:42.682
Huan Zong.

00:31:43.841 --> 00:31:45.321
Huan Zong.

00:31:45.522 --> 00:31:46.242
I'm here.

00:31:48.161 --> 00:31:49.242
Actually,

00:31:49.242 --> 00:31:51.522
I've always envied
your bond with Lin Hu.

00:31:51.601 --> 00:31:53.042
You're always together.

00:31:53.321 --> 00:31:55.522
Though he calls you "Young Master",

00:31:55.722 --> 00:31:56.922
I know

00:31:57.042 --> 00:31:59.962
you're truly

00:32:00.202 --> 00:32:01.801
close friends.

00:32:02.401 --> 00:32:04.601
When I was at Yunhua Sect,

00:32:04.601 --> 00:32:06.641
I had close friends too.

00:32:06.801 --> 00:32:09.161
My senior brothers,

00:32:09.161 --> 00:32:10.361
sisters, and I

00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:12.081
were always together

00:32:12.321 --> 00:32:13.841
just like you and Lin Hu.

00:32:13.922 --> 00:32:15.202
I was really happy back then.

00:32:18.601 --> 00:32:20.161
By that logic,

00:32:21.401 --> 00:32:23.282
I should envy you.

00:32:23.762 --> 00:32:25.081
Envy me?

00:32:25.361 --> 00:32:26.482
Why?

00:32:26.601 --> 00:32:28.242
Because you have many friends.

00:32:30.161 --> 00:32:31.161
Unlike me.

00:32:33.962 --> 00:32:35.161
Day and night,

00:32:35.682 --> 00:32:37.881
I trained rigorously with my master.

00:32:38.561 --> 00:32:39.881
Even now,

00:32:40.242 --> 00:32:41.522
I barely have time

00:32:41.522 --> 00:32:43.161
to interact with juniors.

00:32:43.881 --> 00:32:45.042
So Huan Zong,

00:32:45.202 --> 00:32:46.762
were you brought to Liuguang Sect

00:32:46.801 --> 00:32:48.522
when you were very young?

00:32:48.601 --> 00:32:50.321
I was already grown that year.

00:32:50.442 --> 00:32:52.002
But after family troubles,

00:32:52.242 --> 00:32:52.962
my master took me

00:32:52.962 --> 00:32:54.482
to Liuguang Sect.

00:32:57.184 --> 00:33:01.442
♪Time engraves into rings♪

00:33:01.442 --> 00:33:02.601
All these years,

00:33:03.442 --> 00:33:05.121
only Lin Hu stayed by my side.

00:33:05.321 --> 00:33:06.922
So strictly speaking,

00:33:07.682 --> 00:33:08.242
he's my only

00:33:08.242 --> 00:33:09.242
true friend.

00:33:12.841 --> 00:33:14.282
But it's different now.

00:33:14.321 --> 00:33:15.361
I'm your friend too.

00:33:15.601 --> 00:33:18.042
Now, you have two friends.

00:33:20.881 --> 00:33:21.561
Yes.

00:33:22.962 --> 00:33:23.962
Now, there's you too.

00:33:25.922 --> 00:33:26.881
Actually,

00:33:26.881 --> 00:33:28.081
you've always hidden

00:33:28.081 --> 00:33:29.202
Master Writer identity

00:33:29.202 --> 00:33:30.482
because you think

00:33:30.561 --> 00:33:32.321
a Luanfeng Peak cultivator

00:33:32.321 --> 00:33:33.682
shouldn't do that, right?

00:33:38.161 --> 00:33:39.601
But I don't think so.

00:33:39.801 --> 00:33:41.161
I've told you before,

00:33:41.321 --> 00:33:43.202
you're a person,

00:33:43.202 --> 00:33:44.482
not a sword.

00:33:44.522 --> 00:33:45.922
You have the right to do whatever

00:33:45.922 --> 00:33:47.161
you want to do.

00:33:47.482 --> 00:33:49.242
If you still feel

00:33:49.242 --> 00:33:50.801
a bit embarrassed about it,

00:33:50.841 --> 00:33:52.801
I can help you hide

00:33:52.801 --> 00:33:54.282
your identity as Master Writer.

00:33:54.282 --> 00:33:54.801
However,

00:33:54.801 --> 00:33:56.242
you must promise me one thing.

00:33:58.161 --> 00:33:59.081
What is it?

00:33:59.801 --> 00:34:01.722
You must finish

00:34:01.722 --> 00:34:02.722
new storybooks soon.

00:34:02.722 --> 00:34:03.881
I've been waiting too long.

00:34:03.881 --> 00:34:04.962
I'm desperate to read them.

00:34:05.002 --> 00:34:06.641
If you write new storybooks,

00:34:06.641 --> 00:34:07.841
I'll help keep

00:34:07.841 --> 00:34:08.561
this secret safe.

00:34:10.641 --> 00:34:11.362
Okay.

Wake up.

00:35:16.882 --> 00:35:17.601
Huan Zong,

00:35:17.681 --> 00:35:19.201
why was I lying on your lap?

00:35:22.002 --> 00:35:23.281
What's wrong with you?

00:35:24.241 --> 00:35:26.161
My legs went numb from you
lying there all night.

00:35:27.842 --> 00:35:29.042
Then let me

00:35:29.042 --> 00:35:30.442
massage them for you.

00:35:35.161 --> 00:35:35.882
No need.

00:35:37.281 --> 00:35:38.241
Why not?

00:35:40.561 --> 00:35:41.561
Because

00:35:43.721 --> 00:35:45.121
we should keep a distance.

00:35:53.201 --> 00:35:54.482
But remember this.

00:35:54.842 --> 00:35:56.121
You don't need to massage me,

00:35:56.362 --> 00:35:57.482
and never massage others.

00:35:57.601 --> 00:35:58.281
Understand?

00:35:59.601 --> 00:36:00.601
I'll remember.

00:36:02.882 --> 00:36:03.882
Where's Lin Hu?

00:36:12.402 --> 00:36:14.402
Lin Hu, you're back.

00:36:14.402 --> 00:36:16.322
Come on. Let's drink.

00:36:20.081 --> 00:36:20.761
We...

00:36:20.962 --> 00:36:21.641
We'll be

00:36:21.641 --> 00:36:23.002
friends for life,

00:36:23.002 --> 00:36:23.641
right?

00:36:25.721 --> 00:36:27.121
But I'm telling you.

00:36:27.442 --> 00:36:28.761
I can't continue today.

00:36:28.962 --> 00:36:31.241
It's time for me to sleep.

00:36:32.362 --> 00:36:34.601
Lin Hu, where are you going?

00:36:35.721 --> 00:36:36.241
Breakfast.

00:36:36.241 --> 00:36:37.322
Don't touch my seeds.

00:36:37.322 --> 00:36:39.402
Why are you taking my seeds?

00:36:40.241 --> 00:36:40.922
Give them to him.

00:36:41.081 --> 00:36:41.882
Here you go!

00:36:44.442 --> 00:36:45.962
You two, good night.

00:36:46.042 --> 00:36:47.042
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:36:50.962 --> 00:36:51.882
Huan Zong,

00:36:52.042 --> 00:36:53.922
why are you bidding him goodnight?

00:36:54.002 --> 00:36:56.161
If he sleeps
in that water vat all night,

00:36:56.241 --> 00:36:59.042
he'll definitely wake up sore tomorrow.

00:36:59.042 --> 00:37:00.042
Then he'll start yelling

00:37:00.042 --> 00:37:01.402
at us again.

00:37:01.802 --> 00:37:04.241
Foxes have flexible bodies.

00:37:04.241 --> 00:37:06.161
Sleeping in a vat won't harm him.

00:37:06.522 --> 00:37:07.802
True.

00:37:07.922 --> 00:37:08.922
Wait.

00:37:09.081 --> 00:37:10.402
He ate so many of my seeds.

00:37:10.402 --> 00:37:11.802
He finished them all.

00:37:12.042 --> 00:37:12.962
I'll buy you more.

00:37:13.281 --> 00:37:14.681
No. I don't want it.

00:37:14.802 --> 00:37:17.002
I want revenge.

00:37:19.681 --> 00:37:20.601
Look.

00:37:22.042 --> 00:37:22.761
Look!

00:37:23.161 --> 00:37:24.842
Why's this guy sleeping here?

00:37:25.641 --> 00:37:27.042
He probably did something wrong,

00:37:27.161 --> 00:37:28.561
so he was stripped by his wife

00:37:28.601 --> 00:37:29.522
and got kicked out.

00:37:29.601 --> 00:37:31.482
W-What happened?

00:37:31.482 --> 00:37:32.161
Oh, my.

00:37:32.522 --> 00:37:33.522
Are you alright?

00:37:41.761 --> 00:37:43.121
W-What are you doing?

00:37:43.121 --> 00:37:44.121
What's there to see?

00:37:45.681 --> 00:37:46.641
Stop looking!

00:37:46.641 --> 00:37:47.561
Everyone, stop looking!

00:37:48.402 --> 00:37:49.402
What's going on?

00:37:49.581 --> 00:37:50.081
Let's go.

00:37:50.081 --> 00:37:51.721
Everyone, show's over.

00:37:52.081 --> 00:37:53.522
My apologies for the scene.

00:37:53.761 --> 00:37:54.922
Alright, Lin Hu.

00:37:54.922 --> 00:37:55.922
I've already apologized.

00:37:55.922 --> 00:37:57.522
Don't be angry anymore.

00:37:57.522 --> 00:37:58.322
Have some seeds.

00:37:59.241 --> 00:38:00.761
I wouldn't dare be angry.

00:38:01.121 --> 00:38:02.241
Seeds?

00:38:02.522 --> 00:38:04.522
Yesterday, someone

00:38:04.522 --> 00:38:05.802
treated me so harshly

00:38:06.081 --> 00:38:07.121
over some seeds.

00:38:08.601 --> 00:38:11.002
Sleeping in a vat all night
causes neck pain.

00:38:11.042 --> 00:38:12.201
Are you okay?

00:38:12.201 --> 00:38:13.042
Have some seeds.

00:38:13.322 --> 00:38:14.962
I told you before.

00:38:15.042 --> 00:38:16.922
Lin Hu is the embodiment of a fox.

00:38:16.922 --> 00:38:18.561
Sleeping in a vat isn't a big deal.

00:38:19.482 --> 00:38:20.322
Young Master,

00:38:20.322 --> 00:38:21.201
when did you learn

00:38:21.201 --> 00:38:22.522
to bully me together with her?

00:38:22.601 --> 00:38:23.322
You've changed.

00:38:23.322 --> 00:38:25.042
Search your conscience and tell me.

00:38:25.121 --> 00:38:26.761
Among all the people
in the Liuguang Sect,

00:38:26.802 --> 00:38:28.561
who doesn't know
that I'm the best to you?

00:38:29.042 --> 00:38:31.121
Yes, yes. You are the best to me.

00:38:32.042 --> 00:38:33.121
Lin Hu.

00:38:33.442 --> 00:38:34.962
Yesterday, your young master

00:38:34.962 --> 00:38:36.962
was so happy

00:38:37.002 --> 00:38:38.721
while moving the vat with me.

00:38:38.842 --> 00:38:39.802
He also moved it?

00:38:40.681 --> 00:38:41.482
Really?

00:38:41.842 --> 00:38:44.081
I had a few drinks yesterday
and couldn't handle it.

00:38:44.241 --> 00:38:45.522
I can't remember anything.

00:38:45.802 --> 00:38:46.922
Is that true?

00:38:47.121 --> 00:38:48.121
Huan Zong,

00:38:48.161 --> 00:38:49.601
you've truly gone bad.

00:38:49.601 --> 00:38:51.042
You've also learned to play dumb.

00:38:51.121 --> 00:38:52.721
Oh, come on, Kong Hou.

00:38:52.721 --> 00:38:53.721
He learned it all

00:38:53.721 --> 00:38:54.601
from you.

00:38:54.681 --> 00:38:56.081
He learned to play dumb from you.

00:38:56.681 --> 00:38:58.322
Alright, this is for you.

00:39:00.721 --> 00:39:01.802
Sword manual?

00:39:02.161 --> 00:39:04.281
I knew you were the best to me.

00:39:04.561 --> 00:39:05.681
You are forgiven.

00:39:06.081 --> 00:39:07.161
Give it to me.

00:39:12.442 --> 00:39:13.161
Who are you?

00:39:13.241 --> 00:39:14.561
I'm a Hehuan Sect disciple.

00:39:14.561 --> 00:39:16.042
I've come to find Lady Kong Hou.

00:39:16.042 --> 00:39:16.922
Looking for Kong Hou?

00:39:17.002 --> 00:39:18.482
Kong Hou, she's coming for you.

00:39:19.601 --> 00:39:20.442
Coming for me?

00:39:20.442 --> 00:39:21.362
What's the matter?

00:39:21.681 --> 00:39:23.362
Are you Lady Kong Hou?

00:39:23.522 --> 00:39:24.681
Yes, what's wrong?

00:39:24.802 --> 00:39:25.721
I heard

00:39:25.721 --> 00:39:26.681
that you were frightened

00:39:26.681 --> 00:39:27.522
in Hehuan Sect.

00:39:27.522 --> 00:39:29.281
Master Ouyang feels deeply sorry.

00:39:29.362 --> 00:39:30.442
So she sent me here

00:39:30.442 --> 00:39:31.522
to invite you to a banquet.

00:39:31.601 --> 00:39:33.641
She wants to apologize
to you personally.
