That's why we came here late.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.600

such a huge cabinet?

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.410
It's for storing props

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:45.720
How does that sound?

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.610
Do you mean it?

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.160
Terrific.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.480
A playful ode—that's perfect!

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.080
I love that title.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.040
Well, allow me to thank you in advance.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.050
You're welcome.

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.000
Lang,

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.070
why are you still standing here?

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.270
Go wait outside to greet

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:03.200
another poet, who is yet to arrive.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.000
This poet is even purer of heart

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:06.820
than the two of us.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.080
And it's harder to please him.
You must accord him proper respect.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:10.550
Yes!

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.690
Daxiong, did you really manage

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.980
to get him to Chang'an?

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.910
You two are best friends with him.

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:20.110
Would I be bold enough

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.640
to lie to you, gentlemen?

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.270
When will he arrive?

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.270
According to our arrangement,

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.530
he should be here soon.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.970
He'll arrive today?

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:30.600
Youbo and I thought we had to have

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.270
a long stay at Ruan's Restaurant,

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:33.600
waiting for 8 to 10 days.

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:34.870
When he comes today,

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.120
we'll make him drink all the wine

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.720
he's owed us for 10 years all at once.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.520

why is the restaurant
keeping such an animal here?

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.680
Are you in any position to ask that?

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:17.960
Since you're a servant of Sushan Shop,

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.620
you should stay in the kitchen

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:20.960
instead of wandering around.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.750
Yes, sure.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:25.600
Hey, beggar!

Please announce my arrival.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.349
Just say that Leng Ji
from Nanzhou Prefecture has come to beg.

Mr. Leng,

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.190
please don't say that.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:09.540
I was as blind as a bat,

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:11.190
for recognizing you. Why...

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.160
Why did you use the rear door?

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.680
I'll go inform Mr. Xiong right away.

Lu, upon arriving in Chang'an,

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.880
I heard that you're now

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.740
the Yongzhou Judicial Official.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.310
Why would you have time
to visit this restaurant?

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:28.050
please keep my identity secret for now.

-Mr. Leng!

Mr. Leng, we finally met today.

Come on.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.640
Let me introduce you to a gentleman.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.590
This is...

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.550
I'm Lu Wuming.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.160
Yes.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.240
Lu

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:53.790
is an old friend of mine
back in Nanzhou Prefecture.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.030
Isn't it a coincidence?

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.790
He and I have reunited in Chang'an!

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:58.720
That's perfect. Why not let him join us?

00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.350
Sure thing!

00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.830
Hold on.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.530
I'm afraid this is not appropriate.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.150
Why is that, Mr. Ruan?

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:05.820
Have you not prepared

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.220
enough wine for today?

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.020
Today's banquet

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.910
is for poets only.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.250
But this man...

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.160
He's just a servant of Sushan Shop.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:19.790
I've fallen on hard times.
How embarrassing, Mr. Leng.

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:21.050
That's only recently.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.110
He used to be a poet too.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.220
A poet?

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.110
You must be kidding, Mr. Leng.

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:28.110
If you said

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.310
he used to be a house guard,

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:30.910
I would probably believe it.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:32.690
But a poet?

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:35.220
Mr. Leng did embellish my past.

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:37.050
I really shouldn't attend

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:38.640
this banquet for poets.

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:40.920
No way. Ruan Daxiong!

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.340
What does Lu have to do to gain a seat

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.140
in this banquet you're hosting?

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:48.110
If he can't write poetry,

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.440
at least he should be familiar
with others' works, right?

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:53.880
Then I bet you're well versed in the works

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.030
of the previous finest poets.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:55.880
Of course.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.790
I'm not boasting.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.920
I just have to say
I'm not only able to write poetry,

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.550
but also excel in reciting it.

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.310
I know every poet and poem

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:06.630
from the Pre-Qin period,

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.790
the Six Dynasties, and the Sui Dynasty,

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.390
to the current Tang Dynasty.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:14.580
Mr. Ruan, I wonder

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.720
if you have read Cao Zijian's poems.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.980
Do you even need to ask?

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.020
What about Bao Zhao's and Yu Xin's poems?

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:22.480
Isn't the answer obvious?

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:24.160
That being the case,

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.740
I assume you, Mr. Ruan, must have read

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.180
Yuan Wuyou's

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:31.070
and Cheng Zixu's masterpieces.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:32.400
Yuan...

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.110
Yuan Wuyou?

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.000
Cheng Zixu?

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.650
You're hesitant to answer, Mr. Ruan.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:45.520
Oh, well...

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.880
These poets you're talking about,
Yuan and Cheng...

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.530
I bet they lived in the Wei-Jin period...

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.350
No.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:55.750
Most Wei-Jin poets' given names
were in single characters.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.830
These names, "Wuyou" and "Zixu..."

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.880
They lived
in the Southern and Northern Dynasties.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.210
Right. They must live in those dynasties.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:03.880
This is not much of a test, is it?

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:04.590
However,

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.840
the works of these two poets

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.680
are somewhat vulgar.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:14.730
Daxiong,

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:18.000
invite Lu to the banquet already.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.240
Think about the names
of "Yuan Wuyou" and "Cheng Zixu..."

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.440
Those are fake names!

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.170
My apologies, Mr. Ruan.

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:32.630
I just made a joke

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:34.110
to entertain everyone.

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:35.680
Mr. Ruan, if you really don't think

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.270
I'm qualified for a seat in this banquet,

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.030
then I won't impose any further.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:39.750
No, no, no!

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.400
I was being too rude.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:43.740
Lu, I must invite you to the banquet
with reverence now,

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:44.640
or I would appear to lack

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.270
a poet's grace and generosity.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:47.670
Lu, Mr. Leng,

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:49.640
Mr. Gao, Mr. Wang, please!

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.880
Good, Ruan Daxiong.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.440
I see you stand corrected.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:52.970
Let's go!

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:55.350
Let's get in.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:56.480

Daxiong!

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.790
Since I'm the oldest here,

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:19.850
don't mind if I take the seat of honor.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.030
Mr. Leng,

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.140
why would you suddenly come to Chang'an?

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.240
Since the title
of the Four Poets of Nanzhou...

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:37.830
The main reason lied in
the remote and desolate southern region.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:40.110
I was tempered through
wind and rain alone every day.

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:41.790
Though there were inspirations for poetry,

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.650
grandeur was nowhere to be found.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.750
I started

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.300
to feel more and more stifled.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.770
After much consideration,

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.240
I realized I had to free myself
from constraints.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.480
Therefore, I decided to travel far.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.720
Wonderful! Without grand ambitions,

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.130
how can one call himself
a poet of the Tang Empire?

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.440
Venturing beyond the frontier is a must
for those traveling far, right?

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.640
That is why I, Leng Ji,

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.960
plan to pass through Chang'an
and head to the Western Region,

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.000
where I can admire
the lonely moon and the yellow sand

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.680
of desserts in the border area,

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.000
so as to compose sublime poetic pieces!

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.000
Bravo!

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.260
Ruan Daxiong, why are you so excited?

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.010
You're just a tavern owner.

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:23.730
Do you also want to venture
beyond the frontier?

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:25.720
I wouldn't dare to even dream that.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.920
[Drink to the Melody of Songs]

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.640
Mr. Leng,

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.520
I've been thinking the same.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:33.240
Gao Da and I
also intend to travel beyond the borders.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.030
Exactly.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:37.080
Great. This is great!

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.000
[Drink to the Melody of Songs]

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.400
If the three of us truly journey
beyond the frontier together,

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.270
a magnificent chapter
will definitely be added

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:45.730
to the epic of Tang poetry!

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:52.840
[Drink to the Melody of Songs]

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.090
Daxiong, what's with you today?

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.590
Why are you weeping?

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:01.910
The three greatest poets

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.280
of today's world are planning

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:07.200
a heroic journey beyond the frontier.

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:11.480
This scene is actually taking place
in Ruan's Restaurant!

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.410
How can I not be overjoyed?

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:18.200
Here's a toast to you three poets!

[Drink to the Melody of Songs]

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:21.760
Today at this tavern,
old friends have reunited.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.410
With poetic spirit soaring,
I'd like to raise a toast to you too.

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:26.480
Let's drink!

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:27.000
Sure!

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.340

[Drink to the Melody of Songs]

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:35.760
Lu,

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.200
I forgot to introduce
these gentlemen to you.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.880
This is Gao Da.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.480
And this is Wang Youbo.

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:47.510
I made friends with them

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.170
when I adventured in Luoyang.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:52.680
Now, they both enjoy stellar reputations
in the poetry circles.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.400
That said, I still get to

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.590
point out the flaws

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.160
of their works.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.830
You certainly get to do that.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:06.110
Mr. Leng, you haven't changed a bit.

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:08.330
Years ago, we were such jaunty-looking

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.790
elegant young men with jet-black hair.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.760
And now... we have all become

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:15.070
poets of renown

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.110
and pillars of the poetry circles.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:21.750
We Tang poets are in our prime.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:23.270
When shall we venture

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.240
beyond the frontier, if not now?

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:26.350
During this trip,

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.160
I will not only create great works

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.560
for future generations,

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:32.730
but also establish
a legacy of achievement.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:36.830
Mr. Gao,
are you planning to join the army?

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:37.630
Yes, exactly.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.590
I started practicing martial arts
since childhood,

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.000
and then began entertaining myself
with poetry.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.110
Though that can't be called
a waste of time,

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:50.270
I have been truly limited
by scholarly unworldliness.

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.510
In recent years, the Tang Empire's power

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:54.970
has been steadily rising.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.200
But the imperial court
is in so much turmoil

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.240
that many foreign tribes
have taken this chance

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.550
to harass the border area

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:01.750
and the people there.

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:03.990
Given that, I believe

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.010
the vast Western Region

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:09.390
must have a place
for a man like me to make a mark!

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.070
Such uplifting remarks, Mr. Gao.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:14.440
You've voiced the thought of us literates!

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.200
Lu, your manner of speaking

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.100
is even rougher than mine.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.590
But I don't dislike you for that.

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:23.110
Wang Youbo,

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.340
you haven't changed a bit either.

This humble scholar would like to
raise a toast to you three poets.

been presented yet?

You look fine.

in the past few days.

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:17.480
to remember my name.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:18.640
What an honor for me.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:22.520
I'll taste it.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.550
Please.

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:27.480
Sushan is indeed refreshing.

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:28.960
Amazing!

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.880
This delicacy originated
in Shazhou Prefecture.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.550
It was then introduced to Chang'an by us.

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:35.750
In that case,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.880
when we pass by Shazhou
in our journey

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.830
beyond the frontier,

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:40.430
we must try the sushan there.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.640
We have prepared

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.880
four flavors in total.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.030
Now, you're tasting the cherry flavor.

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:46.070
There are three more flavors

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:48.200
for you to savor, distinguished poets.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.130
Wait, everyone.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.720
Today, this is a gathering of poets.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.480
We shouldn't let these iced treats
steal the thunder.

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:58.110
Mr. Ruan, you're suggesting...

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.570
This is the Tang Empire.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.350
We're in Chang'an now.
How can there be no poetry?

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:03.260
Well said!

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:05.160
Daxiong,

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:07.960
are you planning to compose poetry

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.320
in front of everyone?

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.280
That's not it.

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.540
How dare I compose poetry

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.720
in your presence?

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:16.960
There's a special feature
in Ruan's Restaurant.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.760
That is, I'd often hire troupes,

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:20.640
which make extended stays
in various places,

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.960
to perform for my guests.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.680
I've had the somewhat famous

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.520
Xuanhuo Troupe come here today.

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:27.510
Let's invite their songstresses

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:28.840
to sing and dance for us.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.630
I believe they will sing

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.300
some poems composed by you gentlemen.

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:36.940
Good idea! Let's put a mark on the wall,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.060
when a poem of someone's here is sung.

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:41.000
Forget it.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.880
It's not fair to Lu and Mr. Ruan,

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.200
as this game will basically exclude them

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:46.960
and involve the three of us only.

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.720
Are you having cold feet, Mr. Leng?

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.270
The audacious and talented Mr. Leng

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:51.240
that we were with

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.880
by the Yishui River and Luoshui River

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:55.510
was nothing

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:56.590
like you are now.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:59.280
Don't worry about me, Mr. Leng.

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:01.310
I'm honored to just be

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:02.830
a spectator.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.650
But how do we determine the winner

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.550
of this poets' contest in a tavern?

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:09.790
The poet who's poems are most set to music

00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:11.450
will be the winner, of course.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.830
Well...

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.640
Mr. Leng,

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:20.070
are you... afraid of losing?

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:23.720
I won't lose.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.250
What about you, Mr. Gao?

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:29.950
I dare not to decline.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.650
This poets' contest in a tavern

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.850
is truly a remarkable event
in the poetry circles.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.850
As the owner of this place,

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.340
may I also take a part in it?

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:39.930
How about

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.720
I keep score for you?

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:44.590
Sounds good.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:49.640
Everyone, we just arrived today.

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:51.590
In the next 15 days,

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.080
we'll be stationed here.

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:54.590
Therefore...

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.590
Girls, the troupe leader is asking us

00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:59.950
to put in real effort.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:01.550
Sing the songs you should sing,

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:03.790
and don't say anything you should not say.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:05.180
Don't worry, Mr. Sai.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.500
Your words are engraved on our minds.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.890
Right, sisters?

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.510
Yes.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.680
Compared to those poets,

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.210
our employer, Mr. Ruan,

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:26.270
look plumper and curvier.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.110
Sisters, do you understand

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:32.430
what Mr. Hou just said?

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:34.440
Don't just flatter the poets.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.550
Mr. Ruan is the master here.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.340
Make sure
you show tremendous respect to him.

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:40.830
Yes.

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:43.960
Yes.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.920
My name is Sang.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.440
Today, it's such an honor for me to play

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.640
a stringed instrument and sing for you.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:24.880
♫ Osmanthus branches sway,
casting shadows ♫

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:31.480
♫ Years quickly go by,
like clear running torrents ♫

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:37.790
♫ My life is free of mundane affairs ♫

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:43.720
♫ Even idle clouds rest before my eyes ♫

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:45.070
The first poem

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:46.840
was composed by me, Wang Youbo.

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:49.440
Will you two admit defeat?

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.680
The game has just started.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.410
Put a mark on!

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:08.550
[One]

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:11.710
One poem composed
by Mr. Wang Youbo has been sung!

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.360
Mr. Wang took the first point.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.920
Come on, let's drink a toast to him!

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:15.980
-Come on!
-Come on!

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:16.530
Drink up.

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:18.280
Mr. Wang.

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:19.150
Mr. Gao.

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:32.210
My name is Bi. Greetings, gentlemen.

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:40.070
♫ Climbing layered cliffs alone ♫

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.880
♫ I see a solitary crane
seemingly perching on the clouds ♫

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:50.110
♫ Mighty winds roll up
my sorrowful thoughts ♫

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.880
♫ On a mud flat there stand misty trees ♫

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:56.980
Pardon me, fellows.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.530
This poem is mine.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.760
Oh, Mr. Gao...

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:11.840
[One]

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.440
A poem of Mr. Gao Da's has been sung!

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:51.000
♫ The peaks are sealed by snow
in twilight's hush ♫

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.800
Mr. Wang, another poem of yours?

00:35:52.920 --> 00:36:00.320
♫ In the depths of clouds
hides a household ♫

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:02.920
♫ The closed door says no to visitors ♫

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:08.800
♫ The fragrance of plum blossoms
fills the courtyard ♫

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:12.110
Mr. Leng, this is another poem of mine.

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.840
Put a mark on!

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.880
[One]

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:20.000
[Two]

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.670
Two of Mr. Wang Youbo's poems
have been sung!

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.710
I'm temporarily ahead of you, gentlemen.

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.410
Here is a toast to everyone.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.630
My name is Baobao.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:37.520
It means I'm like a leopard,

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.950
though it sounds like asking for a hug.

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:41.280
Enjoy, gentlemen.

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:44.150
When you have a few rounds of drinks
and long for an embrace,

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:45.440
I'll come back to you.

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:58.110
My name is Xiaopa.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.290
Greetings, gentlemen.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:14.230
♫ Slowly, slowly, Mr. Ruan returns ♫

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:19.280
♫ Time flies like a shooting arrow ♫

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:25.030
♫ Holding wine and crabs ♫

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:31.400
♫ Let us cheer for peace and joy ♫

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.150
It's mine!

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.870
T-That's my poem.

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:38.750
Someone is actually singing

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.770
a poem that I, Ruan Daxiong, wrote!

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:45.110
Miss, have my poems started

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:46.840
circulating among the people?

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.000
Yes.

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.670
This...

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.440
This is making me

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.840
feel really awkward

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.700
in front of you three great poets.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.500
I'm very flattered.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:01.190
A poem of Mr. Ruan Daxiong has been sung!

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:04.000
It doesn't count.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:04.800
It shouldn't be counted.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:05.960
[One]

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:06.420
Well...

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.460
Mr. Wang.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.360
This is the poem

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.510
I enjoy singing most.

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:21.370
I didn't expect

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:23.190
to see the author of it in this banquet.

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:24.790
Do I have the honor to propose

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.480
a toast to you, this great poet?

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.730
Miss, that's not quite right.

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:31.350
It should be me proposing a toast to you.

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:32.880
Pour her a glass of wine!

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:54.710
Mr. Leng,

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.890
so far to this point,

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:58.800
none of your poems have been sung.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.000
Here's a toast to you.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:06.550
Mr. Wang,

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:08.920
I've read Mr. Leng's poetry collection.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.070
Though not many poems are in it,

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:11.480
some are truly classic.

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:12.510
They probably

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.530
haven't reached Chang'an yet.

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:20.330
Lu Wuming, I know

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.530
you and Leng Ji are old friends.

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:24.930
As I said, I don't hate you.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.920
But you're in no position

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:28.880
to speak up for him.

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:31.440
Mr. Wang actually means

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.660
that he and I have known

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:35.480
Leng Ji for a longer time.

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:38.000
Mr. Gao, no need to explain to him.

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.140
Today, let's just speak our minds

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:41.510
right here.

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.810
Leng Ji,

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.480
years ago, in Luoyang, the three of us

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:48.150
had equal standing in the poetry circles.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.360
But you chose to leave us

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.700
and go back to Nanzhou.

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:53.480
You claimed that the Four Poets of Nanzhou

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.000
were as close as real brothers.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.440
But what happened in the end?

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.240
The Four Poets of Nanzhou
became a laughingstock!

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.110
Do you think you lost nothing

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:02.480
but your fame in the poetic circles?

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.230
You actually lost
something far more important

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:06.150
than you could imagine!

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:06.960
Mr. Wang,

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:07.920
you...

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.890
This is enough.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.360
Did I say anything wrong?

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:31.000
Those songstresses

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:32.840
were just mediocre.

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:35.720
The poems they sang were quite crude

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:38.910
and way inferior
to the truly refined ones.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.620
I'm far from an expert.

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:41.880
The vulgar dare not

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:44.440
touch my works.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.000
If no one sings my poems today,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.030
I shall punish myself
with three glasses of wine,

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:54.800
stop writing poetry thereafter,

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.670
and never compete with you lot again

00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:59.910
in the rest of my life.

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:17.550
What does he mean by that?

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:19.120
Mr. Wang, back to your seat.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:02.440
This way.
