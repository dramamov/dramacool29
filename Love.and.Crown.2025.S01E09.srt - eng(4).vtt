[Episode 9]

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.770
Father,

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.330
what if His Majesty told her

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.500
that Mr. Li Lu went to his death willingly

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.710
on your orders?

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.130
He would never spell it out.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.330
And I'm doing this for the Ling clan too.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.290
Even so,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.740
aren't you afraid that once Young Lady learns the truth,

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.690
she won't be able to bear it?

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.750
She's a daughter of the Ling clan.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.490
There are things she has to endure!

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.050
And for all

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.380
that she's the Empress,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.490
in the end,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.410
the Ling clan's what she leans on.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.410
Only if the Ling clan stands strong

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.140
can she be safe.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.570
At court now,

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.500
Xiao Huan is closing in on me at every turn.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.770
If I lose the backing of the senior ministers,

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.930
I'll hardly be able to stand.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.260
So,

It fears my Begonia Pendant!

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.770
This pendant must hold Wanwei Herb.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.700
It's a rare medicinal herb.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.020
When it senses poison, it glows and drives the poison away.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.330
With it on you,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.460
no toxin can hurt you.

Moon-Eclipse is the Ghost King's token.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.180
It feeds on Wanwei Herb

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.050
and is born among it.

Planted in a human heart,

it can awaken the host's hidden potential,

but at the cost of their lifespan.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.090
If the host dies,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.610
Moon-Eclipse is left hanging by a thread.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.460
Only by returning to Wanwei Herb

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.610
can it breed and survive.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.330
Li Hongqing oversaw Master's burial back then.

You wouldn't dare?

That only makes me want to hear it more.

You sit on the throne above all

Do you realize

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.410
the Empress Dowager is doing this

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.290

There's no real affection in this palace anyway.

Please don't be angry, Your Majesty.

What would I be upset about?

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.900
I've heard His Majesty chose Minister Xing's daughter

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.380

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.820
showering her with gifts every day.

Minister Xing and the Grand Tutor

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.650

do you think I should grant her?

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.330
Since Your Majesty likes her,

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:15.900
you can decide that yourself.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.410
I like her gentleness

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:19.900
and I like her grace.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.020
Should I name her Consort Rou,
[*"Rou" here means gentleness.]

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:24.650
or Consort Wan instead?
[*"Wan" here means grace.]

If you like her that much...

how about

I just give her the Empress's seat?

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.290
You're quite mistaken.

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.340
The Empress's duty is to run the harem,

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.530
an exhausting task.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.450
How could I bear to let Miss Xing Yiyi

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.770
work herself so hard?

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:49.260
My dear,

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:50.690
you're in a bad mood?

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:54.930
No need for you to worry.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.500
If you're in a bad mood,

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.500
you could simply say so.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.260
I won't take her in, then.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:00.260
Don't you dare.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.290
You should take her in quickly.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:03.290
I still have a pile of harem affairs to manage

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.500
and won't stay here to witness your bliss.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:11.810
Cangcang,

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:14.340
you do care about me after all.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.290
His Majesty chose Yiyi.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.290
He really chose Yiyi?

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:31.650
Would I lie about that?

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.220
That Empress

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.340
was furious.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.530
This Xiao Huan...

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.170
I understand him less and less.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.100
Perhaps His Majesty is simply tired of that Ling father and daughter

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.620
and wants to lean toward your side.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.170
Not necessarily.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:01.980
The Empress has always loved blades and spears,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.220
headstrong and domineering.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.380
Maybe it's Yiyi's gentle, sweet nature

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.380
that Xiao Huan favors more.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.690
Whatever the reason,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.860
it's a good thing in the end.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.740
Ling Cangcang really thinks

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.100
I don't see she's using this

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.500
to reclaim the Phoenix Seal?

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.740
She's digging her own grave.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:39.620
Your Majesty,

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:40.770
please don't be angry.

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:42.980
Who says I'm angry?

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:47.410
They say Miss Xing excels in every refined art,

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.450
with a slim waist, long legs,

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:49.450
and gifted in song and dance.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.020
If she really enters the palace,

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.900
Your Majesty would...

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:58.530
In a few days,

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.900
it'll be the Lotus Banquet the Empress Dowager ordered.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.770
They say she'll be granted a title at the Lotus Banquet.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.170
Xiaoshan,

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.620
go inform the Empress Dowager

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.020
that I've caught a chill,

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.930
and can't help her host the Lotus Banquet.

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.930
And also...

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:17.260
Come here.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.050
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:16.810
Minister Xing,

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.290
your daughter is truly striking in looks.

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:24.140
My dear, what do you think

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.260
of Miss Yiyi's dancing?

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.100
Very good.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.450
If Miss Yiyi enters the palace one day,

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.810
let her dance for us every day.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.020
How about that?

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.050
You may enjoy that by yourself.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:41.860
After all,

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.380
I've always liked blades and spears.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.930
If I were to hurt Miss Yiyi by accident,

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:46.980
that would be awful.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:17.100
Yiyi really is

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:18.860
beautifully made,

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.810
talented and accomplished.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.170
What do you say, Cangcang?

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:26.260
You're absolutely right.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:27.220
Why don't we

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.170
let Miss Yiyi enter the palace sooner,

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.410
so she can keep His Majesty company more often.

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:33.530
Minister Xing.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:35.900
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.410
Are you willing to part with her?

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.650
For Yiyi to receive Your Majesty's favor

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:43.900
is fortune beyond three lifetimes.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.100
How would I dare say I'm unwilling?

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.650
In that case,

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.810
there's no day like today.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.690
Yiyi will stay in the palace tonight.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:55.450
Wait!

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:01.340
Wait!

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:07.900
Who are you,

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.220
daring to make a scene here?

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:10.620
I...

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.900
Yiyi and I already made a lifelong vow.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.900
How outrageously bold...

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.140
Insolent wretch!

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.410
Who sent you to slander my daughter?

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.100
Your Majesty,

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:23.810
Your Majesty the Empress Dowager,

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:24.450
I...

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:27.100
I don't even know this man!

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.100
Yiyi,

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:29.980
how can you be so heartless?

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.410
Which one of the skills you have

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.620
wasn't taught by me?

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:34.900
Shut up!

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.170
Your Majesty,

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.530
this is the Noble Consort you chose so carefully?

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:49.770
Please, calm your anger.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.340
Mother must have been overwhelmed by all the harem affairs.

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:53.260
It's my fault too

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.220
for not easing her burdens sooner.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:56.650
Your Majesty,

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.690
you've worked so hard running the inner palace all these years.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.810
Why not leave these matters to the Empress?

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.410
At your age,

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.620
you deserve some peace and rest.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.340
Your Majesty the Empress Dowager,

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:14.620
please spare me!

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.020
I'll do everything you say from now on.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.020
At court this morning,

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.170
Grand Tutor Ling and others submitted memorials,

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:34.410
saying a man slipped into the royal banquet

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:36.410
and that you failed in your oversight.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.140
Since Xing Yiyi was your personal recommendation,

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.460
with her conduct in question

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.570
and her dignity lost before all,

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.140
you cannot escape blame.

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:50.290
And...

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.220
Why are you stammering?

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.100
Speak!

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.100
Minister Xing

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.140
had impeached you as well.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.140
Talk about everyone kicking you when you're down.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.770
He's just trying to wash his hands clean.

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.020
That old fox.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.100
Your Majesty!

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.020
Your Majesty!

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.450
His Majesty has decreed today

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.170
that the Phoenix Seal be placed in the Empress's care.

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:12.980
They...

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.860
they've already taken the Phoenix Seal away.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:15.930
What?

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:25.260
Satisfied now, my dear?

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:29.410
You knew my plan from the start,

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.900
that's why you chose Xing Yiyi?

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.690
What else?

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:33.340
Did you really think

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:34.740
I actually liked her?

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.100
Whether you like her is your business,

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:38.530
nothing to do with me.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:42.980
I had

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.190
every candidate's background thoroughly checked

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.100
before settling on Xing Yiyi.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.380
Even if you hadn't picked her,

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:49.650
I had other ways.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:50.930
Oh?

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:52.740
What ways?

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.100
All the names I handed you were filtered by me,

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.140
each with their own issues.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.500
So you're saying

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.690
you never meant to choose consorts for me at all?

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.540
Whether you take consorts isn't the point.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:07.340
What matters is

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.100
I've finally got the Phoenix Seal.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.210
You care that much about the Phoenix Seal?

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.410
Only with it in my hand

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.730
can I do what I need to do.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:40.300
Your Majesty,

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.580
please save me!

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.170
I'm...

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.210
I'm already carrying a child.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:48.620
You're carrying a child

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.780
and still dare to dream of marrying into the throne?

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:52.860
You insisted I enter the palace.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.540
You said back then

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:57.900
if I came in to spy on His Majesty for you,

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:01.170
you'd see the Xing clan rise high and smooth.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:02.860
That still doesn't excuse you

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.010
for such deceit and betrayal!

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:07.730
Please, calm your anger.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.010
It was all my negligence.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.410
Please punish me instead.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:13.300
Get up.

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:15.100
At this point,

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.450
blame won't help us.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.690
It's all my fault

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.970
for underestimating that Ling Cangcang.

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:23.620
You're right.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:26.140
Miss Xing,

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.450
we were all tricked by the Empress.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:30.340
She only ever meant to use you

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.690
to snatch back the Phoenix Seal.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.380
She let Zhou slip in too.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:36.140
She's the one

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:38.140
who drove you to this state.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.100
The Empress Dowager spared your life

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:52.140
so you could seize this last chance.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.140
An eye for an eye,

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.300
a tooth for a tooth.

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:59.340
Make the one who ruined you

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.100
pay the price.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.780
Child,

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.820
don't let me down again.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.820
[Linghe Hall]

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:42.970
Your Majesty,

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.900
all the Lingbi Sect files are stored in the Inner Archive.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:58.490
Let's go.

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:16.140
[Inner Archive]

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:25.900
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.410
Your Majesty,

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:40.580
there are over eighty thousand dossiers here.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.300
What you seek really won't be easy to find.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.210
Are you trying

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.970
to mislead me?

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.340
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:52.540
I wouldn't dare!

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.820
Then you'd better talk fast.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.620
If I report to His Majesty that you offended me,

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.540
I can't guarantee

Please, don't be angry!

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.650
In answer to Your Majesty,

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.860
Commander Li

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.450
came here yesterday

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:07.100
and took the dossiers.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.010
He also took

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.140
a...

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:10.490
a coffin.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:13.100
A coffin...

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:22.700
[Inner Archive]

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:33.300
Your Majesty,

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:34.730
shall we

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:36.210
return to Linghe Hall?

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.860
You may go back first.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.340
I'll walk by myself for a while.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:41.010
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:48.580
Xiao Huan must have known

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:49.970
I'd use the Phoenix Seal

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.650
to enter the Inner Archive.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.650
So he moved what I wanted ahead of time.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:56.540
And that thing

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:58.930
is a coffin.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.580
Moon-Eclipse is the Ghost King's token

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:03.380
and can be planted in a human heart.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.170
Perhaps, Master's body

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.900
lies in that coffin,

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.450
with Moon-Eclipse

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.730
still inside him?

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:18.900
What's wrong, Master?

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:23.210
The Ghost King is dangerous.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.860
That Ghost King's committed countless atrocities

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.780
and harmed so many people.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:26.900
None of this

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:28.410
is something you should meddle in.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.100
Remember this:

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.010
in this world,

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.170
the only one who's wholly good to you

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:35.650
is your father.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:37.410
Even I, your master,

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.930
you mustn't trust completely.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:41.580
Master...

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.060
are you really the Ghost King?

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.490
No way...

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:06.930
That's impossible.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.060
It was you.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.170
I'll kill you!

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:17.250
Listen.

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:18.860
Before you ever entered the palace,

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.490
I'd already planned a way out for you.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.170
You can choose to stay,

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:23.250
or

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:24.540
I can send you out of the palace

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:26.540
to live freely with the man you love.

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:28.010
Really?

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:29.010
Of course.

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:30.970
That was part of my plan all along.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.250
Now that I hold the Phoenix Seal,

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:35.250
one decree from me and no one will dare stop you leaving.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.010
They will never let you walk out of here alive.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.650
Why not?

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:57.540
Because

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.450
they

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.450
want you dead!

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:26.540
That useless girl,

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:28.210
good for nothing

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.780
and only making trouble.

Please, calm your anger.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.780
At least Xing Yiyi had the sense

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:34.620
to die at the Empress's hand.

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:37.690
Send word to Minister Xing

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:40.450

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:41.690
and had her tortured to death.

saying Xing Yiyi died miserably in the palace.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.210
I bear an oral decree from His Majesty.

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:06.540
His Majesty asks you to hand over the Phoenix Seal.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:09.250
What?

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.170
Hand over the Phoenix Seal?

Do you know

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:31.210
that these

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:32.930
are all memorials impeaching you?

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.540
This was all arranged by the Empress Dowager.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.410
She ordered Xing Yiyi to kill me,

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.340
never intending to let her live.

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:40.690
I'm well aware of that.

And you still do this?

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:43.450
This is the palace,

not the martial world.

The palace is an arena of power,

not a place for weighing right and wrong.

You want me to hand it over

it glowed.

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:43.730
Is it because his body

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:47.060
was hiding Moon-Eclipse?

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.860
Did you already know

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:57.450
he was the Ghost King,

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.010
and kill him for that?

Cangcang,

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:06.970
there was more to your master than just being the Ghost King.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:09.300
So moving his body

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:13.250
was also to stop Moon-Eclipse from harming the world?

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:15.900
Is that it?

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:21.140
Answer me.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.730
I gave your master my word.

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:34.690
He had no right to decide for me!

Why?

I killed him

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:18.010
because I had no choice.

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:27.250
Because he was the Ghost King,

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.100
