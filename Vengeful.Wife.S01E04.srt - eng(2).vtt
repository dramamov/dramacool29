00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.299
You're a murder suspect.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:52.619
Join us at the station.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:53.780
What?

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.060
Sir,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.659
there must be some mistake.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.880
How could he be involved in murder?

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.179
The case is under investigation.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.759
No details can be disclosed now.

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:04.459
Take him.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:04.980
Wait!

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.060
Clarified the facts

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.980
before arresting him.

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:12.480
Honey,

00:01:13.019 --> 00:01:13.739
don't worry.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.379
I'll go with them.

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:17.060
I'm innocent.

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:18.579
I'll return safely.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:20.159
Okay,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.200
honey.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.420
Mr. Ye,

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:24.540
shall we?

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:34.620
Min!

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.280
Yes?

00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:37.019
Get Mr. Yan immediately

00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:37.859
to accompany Mr. Ye.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.819
Right away.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.040
Mrs. Ye,

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.859
name your price and I'll pay it.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.580
I swear

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.939
I won't press charges against your son.

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:16.180
Lin Yuanshan,

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.699
you think

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.500
I want your money?

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.740
Aren't you all about money?

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.819
We want not only your wealth,

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:34.060
but also your life.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.340
Your birth chart shows regal fortune,

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:38.860
destined for prosperity.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:40.900
I'll borrow your destiny

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:42.539
to fulfill my son's fate.

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:59.860
Using

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.020
the Twelve Destiny Manipulation Skill,

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.379
I'll insert these steel needles

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:09.180
into your vital organs

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:13.219
to claim your destiny.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.139
You crazy old hag!

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:17.539
You're crazy!

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.219
This is a new era!

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:20.659
Still believing in this nonsense!

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:23.580
You superstitious old fool!

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:25.620
When my son returns,

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:27.300
I'll perform the ritual.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.180
However,

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.860
your current fate is too resilient.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.740
Let's start with some bloodletting.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.180
If my husband broke the law,

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.419
let justice take its course.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.300
But I believe he's innocent.

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:46.780
I trust your department

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.620
will uphold justice.

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.680
Ms. Lin,

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.979
rest assured.

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.300
We'll clear Mr. Ye's name.

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:53.039
Great!

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:56.479
Xia,

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.580
if he's really

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.460
related to the murder,

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.259
what will you do?

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.180
Impossible!

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.800
At the crucial period

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.139
of the group handover,

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:04.500
someone's obviously framing him

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.060
to sabotage Jiuyao Group.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.000
Appearances can be deceiving.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.020
Why him

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.699
of all people in the group?

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.060
If it's true,

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.020
what would you do?

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.979
Whoever breaks the law

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:16.459
must face punishment.

00:04:17.267 --> 00:04:19.660
(Police Interrogation Room)

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.300
Ye Dong,

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.939
this surveillance footage

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:24.819
shows you speeding

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.620
with Bai Cha beside you.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.000
Soon after,

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.899
she disappeared.

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.399
Heavy bloodstains were found
by the cliff

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.819
near the surveillance zone.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.779
It's verified

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:36.540
the blood belongs to Bai Cha.

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.839
Ye Dong,

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:39.699
confess truthfully

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.899
where her body is.

00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:45.740
I gave her a ride

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:48.180
because we knew each other.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.500
As to what happened after that,

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:52.139
I have absolutely no idea.

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:53.660
But Mr. Luo,

00:04:54.019 --> 00:04:54.860
that mountain area

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:55.699
hosts wildlife.

00:04:56.459 --> 00:04:57.220
You'd better

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.139
step up the search.

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:59.579
Make sure she won't

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:00.699
end up as prey.

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:01.620
You're lying.

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:03.699
You killed her!

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.540
Mr. Luo,

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.779
mind your position.

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.100
You're publicly slandering me!

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.740
I want my lawyer.

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:13.959
Fine.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:15.500
Then explain

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:16.980
how you met Bai Cha.

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:21.060
We

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:22.860
met at a resort hotel

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.100
by coincidence.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.699
Also there was her husband

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:26.519
Cheng Nuo.

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:30.259
Such a coincidence?

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:32.579
Did you

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:34.339
meet before?

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.699
Or

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.980
were you lovers?

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.300
So it's a crime of passion.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.379
I'll say this one last time.

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:46.339
I had nothing to do with her case.

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:48.259
If you have evidence,

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:50.040
then charge me.

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:52.420
You're the prime suspect now.

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:53.939
Want evidence?

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:55.100
It's easy to find.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.560
Master.

00:05:58.019 --> 00:05:58.860
Chief is calling you.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.819
What's wrong?

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:13.420
Are you insane?

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:14.339
What happened?

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:15.540
An old hag

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.740
smashed your wedding photo!

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.819
What?

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.660
Disgraceful!

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:20.939
Shameless!

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.180
Taking these indecent photos

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.220
brings shame

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.620
to the Ye family.

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:27.500
How dare you display it

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.600
in the most visible spot!

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.339
If relatives or friends see this,

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:31.579
won't you feel ashamed?

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:32.860
Mom,

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.779
those are artistic wedding portraits.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.660
They were taken by a famous...

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.779
Nonsense art!

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:39.860
The Ye family has its own traditions.

00:06:40.579 --> 00:06:41.459
No more

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:42.899
of such vulgar things.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.019
Not a single copy remains!

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.579
Destroy it!

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:46.199
Step on it!

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.120
Step!

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:48.399
You old hag!

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:49.379
You're going too far!

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.459
This is

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:51.740
the Lin family's home,

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:52.899
not the Ye's!

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:54.420
- You...
- You have no right

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.500
to smack things here.

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:57.180
In all my life,

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.899
I've never seen such a tyrannical

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:00.100
and mentally twisted person.

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:01.319
Xia,

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:02.819
so this is Ye Dong's cruel mother?

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:04.180
Like mother,

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.420
like son.

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:06.980
Given Ye Dong's behavior,

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.060
he's no saint either.

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:09.600
Wake up, Xia!

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.660
You shouldn't have

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.040
made him the acting CEO.

00:07:12.459 --> 00:07:13.459
Justice prevailed!

00:07:13.459 --> 00:07:14.699
The police officers came

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:16.939
and arrested

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:17.939
that murderer.

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:19.100
Na, stop it.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.699
What?

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:20.759
Ye Dong

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:22.220
was arrested by the police?

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:22.899
Lin Xia,

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:23.939
what happened?

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:25.240
Don't worry, Mom.

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:27.220
He is just giving a statement

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.379
and will return soon.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.779
I saw it this morning

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.259
that he's destined for prison.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.199
He may be back soon.

00:07:33.439 --> 00:07:34.100
Or he may

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:35.740
never return.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.819
I'll shut your trap myself!

00:07:37.899 --> 00:07:38.779
Bring in on then!

00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:39.279
You!

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
You old hag!

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:43.980
Both of you!

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:45.839
I'll tear your mouth apart!

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:47.259
Stop fighting!

00:07:52.019 --> 00:07:52.899
Stop!

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:54.980
We can't do this.

00:07:56.139 --> 00:07:57.819
He's our prime suspect.

00:07:57.819 --> 00:07:58.779
We can't release him.

00:07:59.399 --> 00:08:00.439
Don't be stubborn.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.699
The Speaker himself called me

00:08:02.939 --> 00:08:03.699
and started

00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:04.579
lecturing me harshly.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:05.779
I can't handle this.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.800
Moreover,

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.199
we don't have concrete evidence.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.220
I'm absolutely sure

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:11.500
he's the murderer.

00:08:12.579 --> 00:08:13.620
Show me the evidence,

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:14.720
and I'll cover you.

00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:16.120
If you can't,

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.100
release him!

00:08:17.139 --> 00:08:18.300
There must be evidence.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.720
Just give me more time.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.560
Then release him first!

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.319
Deal?

00:08:23.019 --> 00:08:24.379
We can't release him

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:25.300
before 24 hours.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.259
This is rule.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.100
Unless you claim the Speaker

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.339
is above the law?

00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:33.059
Recording is

00:08:33.139 --> 00:08:33.940
enabled by accident.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:35.360
You...

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.200
Of course, he's not.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.960
Follow standard procedures.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:43.059
Wise decision!

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.128
(Lin Na)

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:13.620
Master.

00:09:15.899 --> 00:09:16.539
Cheng Nuo!

00:09:17.179 --> 00:09:17.899
Perfect timing.

00:09:18.299 --> 00:09:19.899
I have more questions for you.

00:09:20.179 --> 00:09:20.779
Mr. Luo,

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.340
I need to speak with you too.

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:23.940
A mix-up.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:24.779
A huge mix-up.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.460
My wife Bai Cha

00:09:26.779 --> 00:09:27.419
has been found.

00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:30.820
Found?

00:09:31.059 --> 00:09:31.779
Yes.

00:09:32.139 --> 00:09:32.700
What happened?

00:09:34.419 --> 00:09:35.580
She went hiking

00:09:35.659 --> 00:09:37.019
with her friend Ai Li.

00:09:37.259 --> 00:09:38.940
As Ai Li's phone died,

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:39.620
we lost contact.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.059
When we finally reached her,

00:09:41.059 --> 00:09:41.700
we discovered

00:09:42.019 --> 00:09:42.980
my wife fell off a cliff

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:43.820
accidentally.

00:09:45.139 --> 00:09:45.820
Fortunately,

00:09:46.059 --> 00:09:47.299
she's stable

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.080
and has been hospitalized.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.500
Sorry for the trouble.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.059
Mr. Luo,

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:57.980
what's wrong?

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.820
Your wife and Ye Dong

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.620
knew each other, huh?

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:06.700
No,

00:10:07.179 --> 00:10:08.460
we met at the hotel.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.960
Ye Dong's very magnanimous

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.480
and generous.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.620
We instantly clicked.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.019
Mr. Luo, if nothing else,

00:10:18.019 --> 00:10:19.179
I'll go tend to my wife.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.340
At least she's safe.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.639
In this case,

00:10:24.139 --> 00:10:25.179
we will need

00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:26.399
her statement.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.259
Okay.

00:10:31.659 --> 00:10:33.320
But she's recovering in the hospital.

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:34.639
She needs rest.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.200
After she recovers,

00:10:36.419 --> 00:10:37.539
I'll bring her here

00:10:38.259 --> 00:10:38.779
to check it.

00:10:38.779 --> 00:10:39.299
Okay?

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:40.600
Fine.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.220
But proper procedures

00:10:42.419 --> 00:10:43.019
must be obeyed.

00:10:43.019 --> 00:10:43.519
Naturally.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:44.840
Silly Qiang,

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.820
accompany him to the hospital

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:47.659
to confirm it.

00:10:49.179 --> 00:10:49.860
Yes, sir!

00:10:55.379 --> 00:10:56.659
While taking photos,

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.059
I stood too close to the edge.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.639
Slipped and fell.

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:01.919
Luckily I got immediate care.

00:11:02.159 --> 00:11:03.659
I'm out of danger now.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.379
Thank you for your concern.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.440
Alright.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.019
Thank you.

00:11:10.539 --> 00:11:11.159
Sir,

00:11:11.659 --> 00:11:12.340
thank you

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:13.580
for coming all this way.

00:11:13.759 --> 00:11:15.000
It's just a misunderstanding.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:16.620
Right now,

00:11:17.059 --> 00:11:18.299
I just want my wife

00:11:18.759 --> 00:11:19.919
to heal properly

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:21.659
and get well soon.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:22.860
So,

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:23.740
I hope this matter...

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:24.799
Don't worry.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:25.919
Almost done here.

00:11:28.059 --> 00:11:28.940
I wish your wife

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:29.700
a speedy recovery.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:30.440
Goodbye.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:31.980
Thank you.

00:11:37.203 --> 00:11:40.288
(Bai Cha's best friend Ai Li)

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.539
What's going on here?

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:42.539
Didn't you say

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:43.620
you cleaned it up?

00:11:43.899 --> 00:11:44.399
Dong,

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:45.899
at the cliff that day,

00:11:45.899 --> 00:11:47.139
I just found some blood,

00:11:47.419 --> 00:11:48.419
not Bai Cha's body.

00:11:48.659 --> 00:11:49.259
I thought,

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.419
falling off the cliff,

00:11:50.419 --> 00:11:51.340
she must be dead.

00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:52.399
Besides,

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.340
wild beasts

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.379
were roaming nearby.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.340
She must've been dragged away.

00:11:56.419 --> 00:11:57.059
So,

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.360
I just left.

00:11:59.539 --> 00:12:01.220
You almost ruined everything.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.000
Dong,

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:03.340
I really didn't mean to.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:04.940
The police

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.519
have cleared you of suspicion,

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.500
which means Bai Cha

00:12:07.659 --> 00:12:08.620
must still be alive.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.080
Right.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.740
She's not dead yet.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.620
That means I have hope.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:19.200
Yes.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.220
Go investigate her whereabouts.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:26.740
Got it.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.379
She can only be my woman.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:30.820
