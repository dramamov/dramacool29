00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.979
Honey.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:00.340
Honey.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.100
Where are you?

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.079
Honey,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.760
you can see now?

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.260
Where are you, honey?

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:10.459
I just dreamed about Dad.

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:13.900
He was covered in blood.

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:15.659
Just like Mom.

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:17.120
Honey, where are you?

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.519
I'm so scared.

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:21.379
Honey.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.180
Honey.

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:25.719
Honey.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.060
It's okay.

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:31.980
It's okay.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.140
Just a nightmare.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.000
I visited Dad today.

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:37.340
He's fine.

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.579
No.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.420
No.

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:41.500
It felt so real.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.579
It was absolutely terrifying.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.780
Alright.

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.359
Stop crying.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.159
Dreams go by contraries.

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.459
Dad will live a long life.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.719
(We clearly made eye contact.)

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.020
(Was that...)

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.719
(just my imagination?)

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.060
(It's bad.)

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.900
(He suspects I can see.)

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.620
(I can't let him find out.)

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.620
Honey.

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.099
Why do you smell

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.159
of a woman's perfume?

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.900
Why do I smell it here, too?

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:30.199
Honey.

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.919
Really?

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:32.479
Yes.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.560
How could there be women's perfume?

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.120
Why the perfume smell?

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.439
Honey,

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.879
I remember now.

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:53.599
In the elevator today,

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:55.000
there was a woman

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.840
wearing strong, cheap perfume.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.319
It gave me a headache.

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:59.780
Come to think of it,

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.379
my head still hurts.

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:06.199
Don't be so mean.

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:10.740
(She can still laugh?)

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:13.000
(It proves her eyes)

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.219
(haven't recovered.)

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.919
(Ye Dong,)

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:18.680
(you monster.)

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.039
(I want to tear you apart.)

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.979
(I was blind.)

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.139
(I let the wolf in.)

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.500
(I killed Dad.)

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.500
Who?

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:31.280
Who's shouting?

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.379
Ms. Lin,

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.919
I'm Qin Yufei.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.879
Here to deliver documents.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:41.539
Are you okay?

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.800
Y...

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:44.020
Yes.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.180
Dong,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.879
there's an old mutt

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.280
dead in the basement.

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:51.680
Go dispose of it.

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:54.400
Mom,

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.080
since when do we have an old dog?

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:00.740
Some stray crawled into the basement.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.960
Honey.

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:07.060
Quick.

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:08.120
Go help Mom.

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:09.199
Help her out.

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:10.819
Mr. Ye,

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:11.539
Ms. Lin,

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.060
if there's nothing else,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.400
I'll take my leave.

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:16.079
Wait.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.279
Mr. Ye,

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.120
any other orders?

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:25.360
Yufei,

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:26.920
since you're here,

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.120
do me a favor.

00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:29.399
Lend a hand.

00:04:30.579 --> 00:04:31.279
Mr. Ye,

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:33.000
I'm scared of dogs.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.139
It's just a dead dog.

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:35.579
Nothing to fear.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:37.459
Come.

00:04:43.579 --> 00:04:44.220
Honey,

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:45.459
stay here

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.019
and rest.

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:47.339
I'll be right back.

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:12.079
Honey.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.600
What's wrong,

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.980
honey?

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.980
Come with me.

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:42.420
Honey,

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.740
is anything wrong?

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.279
Just come with me.

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:10.319
It's all sorted out.

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:11.560
Come in and help.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.600
Lady,

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:13.319
this work...

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.319
I really can't do it.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.420
We're in this together.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.819
How could you stay clean?

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.860
Let's go.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.420
Honey,

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.480
why did you stop?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.459
The stench is overwhelming.

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:54.579
Honey,

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.439
are you okay?

00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:58.620
Yes.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.120
I'm okay.

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:02.879
It's just...

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:04.240
I suddenly feel nauseous.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:13.800
Xia,

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:15.740
your complexion looks

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.740
a bit off.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.560
Are you feeling unwell?

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:22.480
It's nothing.

00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:23.720
I'm fine.

00:07:24.019 --> 00:07:26.079
I'll cook you something nutritious later

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:27.439
to boost your health.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.600
No need.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:30.439
Dong,

00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:32.139
two more bags inside.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.600
Go help us.

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:41.300
(Dad,)

00:07:42.459 --> 00:07:44.459
(your death was so tragic.)

00:07:48.019 --> 00:07:48.699
Yufei,

00:07:49.079 --> 00:07:50.220
thank you for helping today.

00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:52.480
I'll remember this kindness.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.079
Honey,

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.139
don't wander off.

00:08:23.899 --> 00:08:24.959
Wait here for me.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.800
I'll be right back.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.000
Baba.

00:09:32.419 --> 00:09:33.039
I'm here.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:33.639
Master.

00:09:33.919 --> 00:09:34.899
Call Na.

00:09:35.919 --> 00:09:36.659
Okay.

00:09:40.039 --> 00:09:40.700
Hello.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:41.919
Na.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.720
My mother-in-law
has been staying with us for days.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.279
I haven't bought her any gifts yet.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.200
So...

00:09:49.379 --> 00:09:50.919
could you help me buy

00:09:50.919 --> 00:09:52.299
some high-end gold jewelry?

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.860
Around five million in value will do.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.419
I want to surprise her.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.179
Alright.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.440
It hurts.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:42.919
Honey.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:44.899
Honey.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.480
When did you get here?

00:10:48.019 --> 00:10:48.840
You walked quietly.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.200
You scared me to death.

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:52.360
Honey.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.759
You dropped something.

00:10:55.799 --> 00:10:56.860
What is it?

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.299
Honey.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.120
When did you find this?

00:11:10.519 --> 00:11:11.600
When I came upstairs,

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.639
I accidentally lost it

00:11:13.019 --> 00:11:14.320
and couldn't find it.

00:11:16.639 --> 00:11:17.559
I see.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.360
Then I'll...

00:11:21.019 --> 00:11:22.340
tie a tight knot for you.

00:11:24.799 --> 00:11:26.039
Then it won't fall off.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:28.519
Okay.
