(Episode 3)

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:54.600
(Min Woo, Min Jun's Mom)

00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:06.812
Why won't he pick up?

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:09.148
I have to tell them this news right away.

00:01:36.776 --> 00:01:38.511
Incredible.

00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:40.546
Cho Na Jeong, you're amazing.

00:01:40.546 --> 00:01:43.683
You just rushed there but got accepted.

00:01:43.683 --> 00:01:45.551
Yes. Thank you so much.

00:01:45.551 --> 00:01:47.587
This is all thanks to you, Jin Hee.

00:01:48.054 --> 00:01:49.388
Yeah.

00:01:49.388 --> 00:01:50.923
Now that I think about it,

00:01:50.923 --> 00:01:53.392
borrowing my outfit
must've done the trick.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.363
Hey, you know I have
a pretty good sense of style.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.733
Right, I thought so too.

00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:02.768
So are you working right away?

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:05.671
No, that was round two.
There's still a third round.

00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:06.973
- Again?
- Yeah.

00:02:06.973 --> 00:02:09.308
Why so many rounds?

00:02:09.876 --> 00:02:11.344
What's the third one?

00:02:11.344 --> 00:02:12.778
That's a camera test.

00:02:12.778 --> 00:02:14.046
I have to show up looking flawless.

00:02:14.614 --> 00:02:17.683
I need to pick the product I'll present
and practice too.

00:02:17.683 --> 00:02:19.352
There are tons to do.

00:02:19.352 --> 00:02:20.620
Really?

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.722
Then that's serious.

00:02:22.722 --> 00:02:24.690
All the show hosts on TV...

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.160
looked so polished.

00:02:29.028 --> 00:02:31.497
Jin Hee, I'm just not dressed up yet.

00:02:31.497 --> 00:02:32.999
Once I do,

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:34.433
game over.

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:35.501
Did anyone say otherwise?

00:02:37.303 --> 00:02:38.638
But, Jin Hee,

00:02:38.938 --> 00:02:40.973
what's all this stuff?

00:02:40.973 --> 00:02:42.575
Are you selling dish scrubbers or what?

00:02:42.575 --> 00:02:45.144
The kids' flea market
is the week after next.

00:02:45.378 --> 00:02:47.346
Ah Young wants to sell these then,

00:02:47.346 --> 00:02:49.949
so I bought a bunch of scrubber yarn,
but I'm handling it all.

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:51.150
Right.

00:02:52.518 --> 00:02:53.719
This is bad.

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:56.055
I have to prepare for the final interview.
I don't have time.

00:02:56.055 --> 00:02:58.891
Hey, no matter how busy you are,
you have to go.

00:02:58.891 --> 00:03:01.093
The kids have been
looking forward to it so much.

00:03:12.405 --> 00:03:13.306
You're late.

00:03:15.141 --> 00:03:17.243
Hey, did you hear?

00:03:18.544 --> 00:03:21.280
I had a second interview
at Sweet Home Shopping,

00:03:21.547 --> 00:03:22.515
and I passed.

00:03:23.082 --> 00:03:24.417
Sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.

00:03:25.418 --> 00:03:27.053
You know, at the interview, I...

00:03:27.053 --> 00:03:28.087
I can't even.

00:03:29.322 --> 00:03:30.389
Are you joking?

00:03:30.857 --> 00:03:32.425
You just get on with it
and tell me afterwards?

00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:33.593
Then why act like you care what I say?

00:03:34.527 --> 00:03:36.362
Just don't come to me later
saying it's tough...

00:03:36.362 --> 00:03:38.331
or asking why I didn't stop you.

00:03:38.598 --> 00:03:40.533
Why would you say that?

00:03:40.533 --> 00:03:42.401
It's not like I'm abandoning the family.

00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:43.769
I'm just trying to do my job.

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.371
Mom.

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.940
What are you doing?
He's calling for you.

00:03:51.844 --> 00:03:54.180
What's with him?

00:03:56.282 --> 00:03:57.984
I can't even.

00:03:57.984 --> 00:04:00.720
I never realized
he could be so selfish and stubborn.

00:04:01.654 --> 00:04:03.356
So that's it.

00:04:03.356 --> 00:04:05.591
He said that first
so I wouldn't ask him to babysit later.

00:04:06.792 --> 00:04:09.262
If you act like that,
do you think I'll quit?

00:04:09.662 --> 00:04:11.330
Just wait and see, Noh Won Bin.

00:04:17.203 --> 00:04:18.171
One, two.

00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:37.156
One more time.

00:04:37.723 --> 00:04:40.326
Lady over there,
don't you want to look better?

00:04:41.494 --> 00:04:43.863
You need to pedal to lose weight.

00:04:53.773 --> 00:04:54.774
All right, one main set.

00:05:17.997 --> 00:05:19.699
(Na Jeong)

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:20.566
You scared me.

00:05:20.933 --> 00:05:22.101
This is "before."

00:05:25.538 --> 00:05:28.007
With the final interview ahead,

00:05:28.007 --> 00:05:30.776
a perfect final look is essential.

00:05:30.776 --> 00:05:33.613
Fashionistas, will you report for duty?

00:05:47.693 --> 00:05:50.897
Does anyone know a hitman's number?

00:05:50.897 --> 00:05:51.797
Why?

00:05:51.797 --> 00:05:53.432
Do I look that terrible?

00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:56.169
That jerk Eom Jong Do...

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:57.670
had another woman.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:58.538
What?

00:06:02.341 --> 00:06:03.643
I saw it for sure.

00:06:04.343 --> 00:06:05.545
It was a kiss.

00:06:06.812 --> 00:06:08.347
He was two-timing me
before we even broke up.

00:06:08.347 --> 00:06:10.883
Nothing else makes sense.

00:06:10.883 --> 00:06:11.651
You're right.

00:06:11.651 --> 00:06:14.453
So I went to his place and waited.

00:06:15.688 --> 00:06:17.824
And it was almost 4 a.m.
when he showed up.

00:06:18.991 --> 00:06:21.027
What kind of trash is that?

00:06:21.027 --> 00:06:21.928
So then?

00:06:34.907 --> 00:06:36.542
Why are you acting like that?

00:06:36.542 --> 00:06:37.577
Hey.

00:06:37.577 --> 00:06:38.845
Clench your jaw.

00:06:46.786 --> 00:06:48.488
Isn't it obvious?

00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:50.590
I beat the crap out of him and came home.

00:06:52.024 --> 00:06:53.292
Good job.

00:06:53.793 --> 00:06:56.562
You should've called me,
and I'd have helped.

00:06:57.964 --> 00:06:59.432
Even grinding him up wouldn't be enough.

00:06:59.665 --> 00:07:01.133
See? What did we tell you?

00:07:01.133 --> 00:07:03.336
We said he was bad news and to dump him.

00:07:03.336 --> 00:07:06.939
Yeah, I should've listened
to my friends sooner.

00:07:10.343 --> 00:07:12.278
Hey, maybe it's for the best.

00:07:12.278 --> 00:07:14.380
At least now you've seen for yourself
what trash he is.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.116
Right. Don't hang on.
Just move on clean.

00:07:17.116 --> 00:07:19.085
Hey, who's hanging on?

00:07:19.085 --> 00:07:21.154
I was just playing with him anyway.

00:07:21.154 --> 00:07:23.189
This time it's really over. Over!

00:07:25.858 --> 00:07:26.659
I've got a truckload of guys...

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:28.728
who'd come running if I call.

00:07:28.728 --> 00:07:30.997
You guys know
how irresistibly charming I am, right?

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.299
What? Jealous, you married ones?

00:07:39.939 --> 00:07:41.807
(Dressing Room)

00:07:49.715 --> 00:07:52.418
Mirror, mirror on the wall,
who's the fairest of them all?

00:07:52.418 --> 00:07:53.286
Me?

00:07:53.286 --> 00:07:55.054
Gosh, I think you're right.

00:07:55.988 --> 00:07:56.956
It says it's me.

00:07:58.157 --> 00:08:00.126
Nope, it says it's me.

00:08:00.827 --> 00:08:01.894
Then take off those sunglasses.

00:08:01.894 --> 00:08:03.229
How could you wear them
when we have nothing?

00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:04.897
Guys, don't we look way too single?

00:08:04.897 --> 00:08:05.832
You are single.

00:08:05.832 --> 00:08:06.666
- Let's go clubbing.
- Should we?

00:08:06.666 --> 00:08:07.500
Club.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.203
- Nice.
- How long has it been?

00:08:15.074 --> 00:08:16.843
This is so good.

00:08:16.843 --> 00:08:18.878
It's been so long
since I've had something this spicy.

00:08:19.345 --> 00:08:21.080
You know what my wish is these days?

00:08:21.781 --> 00:08:24.283
To sleep spread out without the kids,

00:08:24.283 --> 00:08:26.519
and to eat food that's not chopped up.

00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:28.955
Big, hearty bites like this,

00:08:28.955 --> 00:08:30.656
and spicy food.

00:08:31.624 --> 00:08:33.059
You sleep with your kids?

00:08:33.793 --> 00:08:35.161
Not with Won Bin?

00:08:35.394 --> 00:08:36.195
Mostly.

00:08:36.662 --> 00:08:38.965
But if I'm not there when they wake up,

00:08:39.198 --> 00:08:42.702
they start yelling for me,
morning or dawn.

00:08:42.702 --> 00:08:45.371
Then what about your sex life?

00:08:45.805 --> 00:08:47.340
If my husband opens the door,

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.175
I pretend to be asleep.

00:08:49.175 --> 00:08:51.477
If someone installed CCTVs in our house,

00:08:51.777 --> 00:08:52.912
it'd be rated "All Ages."

00:08:52.912 --> 00:08:55.181
We're an incredibly wholesome family.

00:08:56.115 --> 00:08:59.051
I can't even stand to look at him
these days, so I don't even want to.

00:08:59.051 --> 00:09:00.419
I'm done. I'm not doing it anymore.

00:09:00.853 --> 00:09:02.688
We don't find each other
attractive anymore anyway.

00:09:02.688 --> 00:09:03.689
I get it.

00:09:03.923 --> 00:09:06.359
They say about 40 percent of couples
are sexless these days.

00:09:06.359 --> 00:09:08.027
Why? Are you two having issues?

00:09:08.728 --> 00:09:10.129
No.

00:09:10.129 --> 00:09:11.264
It's not that.

00:09:11.264 --> 00:09:14.534
Maybe for Na Jeong it's one thing,
but it's not the same for you two.

00:09:14.534 --> 00:09:15.768
I said it's not like that.

00:09:15.968 --> 00:09:17.403
Hey, if things aren't working out,

00:09:17.403 --> 00:09:19.872
don't be embarrassed
and try marriage counseling.

00:09:19.872 --> 00:09:22.208
Bottling it up won't fix anything.

00:09:22.208 --> 00:09:23.109
True.

00:09:26.012 --> 00:09:26.946
Excuse me.

00:09:32.819 --> 00:09:33.886
Fortune cookies?

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.922
Amazing!

00:09:36.656 --> 00:09:39.859
These fortune cookies are known
to be freakishly accurate.

00:09:40.359 --> 00:09:42.028
But don't say yours out loud.

00:09:42.528 --> 00:09:44.997
You know if you talk about a dream
too soon, it turns bad, right?

00:09:44.997 --> 00:09:46.999
Okay.

00:09:48.734 --> 00:09:50.203
One, two, three.

00:09:54.574 --> 00:09:57.043
A woman with a flower,
a man with a flower.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:58.778
Break the mold.

00:09:59.545 --> 00:10:01.781
A new encounter awaits you.

00:10:06.519 --> 00:10:09.956
A typhoon begins
with the flutter of a butterfly's wings.

00:10:10.756 --> 00:10:12.158
What's this supposed to mean?

00:10:12.158 --> 00:10:13.125
A typhoon?

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:14.827
What?

00:10:14.827 --> 00:10:18.264
Does it mean Jong Do's coming to make up?

00:10:19.165 --> 00:10:20.366
A new encounter?

00:10:21.667 --> 00:10:22.668
Pregnancy?

00:10:23.102 --> 00:10:23.769
What does yours say?

00:10:24.971 --> 00:10:26.873
You said we're not supposed
to say it out loud.

00:10:26.873 --> 00:10:27.907
That's just superstition.

00:10:28.808 --> 00:10:29.842
And you?

00:10:30.943 --> 00:10:32.612
I don't know. It sounds like nonsense.

00:10:33.379 --> 00:10:34.380
You?

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.282
I'm not sure. It's kind of vague.

00:10:50.096 --> 00:10:51.197
You're here.

00:10:51.197 --> 00:10:52.598
- Hey.
- Give me that.

00:10:52.598 --> 00:10:54.267
- Have you eaten dinner?
- Yeah.

00:11:03.709 --> 00:11:04.510
Why?

00:11:05.144 --> 00:11:06.179
Do you have something to say?

00:11:08.548 --> 00:11:09.916
Honey, should we maybe...

00:11:11.417 --> 00:11:13.486
try marriage counseling or something?

00:11:15.955 --> 00:11:16.923
I think...

00:11:17.323 --> 00:11:19.926
I've got some kind of wall up inside,

00:11:21.961 --> 00:11:23.496
and I feel guilty about it.

00:11:25.965 --> 00:11:26.833
You don't want to?

00:11:27.633 --> 00:11:29.302
No, not at all.

00:11:33.439 --> 00:11:35.942
You're being really brave.

00:11:38.511 --> 00:11:39.512
Thank you.

00:11:56.796 --> 00:11:57.730
All right.

00:11:59.632 --> 00:12:03.102
Hello, everyone. Thank you for waiting.

00:12:03.102 --> 00:12:05.238
This is your host Cho Na Jeong,
back again...

00:12:05.238 --> 00:12:06.172
Mom.

00:12:07.473 --> 00:12:08.975
Min Jun, you're awake?

00:12:09.275 --> 00:12:10.376
Let's go.

00:12:10.843 --> 00:12:12.245
You're up.

00:12:36.235 --> 00:12:38.337
It's okay.

00:12:38.604 --> 00:12:40.540
Let's go back to sleep.

00:12:42.074 --> 00:12:43.409
Good night.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.681
Good night.

00:13:31.524 --> 00:13:35.027
Hello, everyone.
You've been waiting so long, right?

00:13:35.027 --> 00:13:38.664
This is your shopping host,
Cho Na Jeong, back again!

00:13:39.799 --> 00:13:42.401
Everyone, with this dry weather lately,

00:13:42.401 --> 00:13:44.904
your skin must be struggling, right?

00:13:44.904 --> 00:13:46.439
That's why now, more than ever,

00:13:46.439 --> 00:13:49.008
you need extra skin care.

00:13:49.008 --> 00:13:50.977
So, the product I brought today...

00:13:51.677 --> 00:13:52.478
is...

00:13:53.779 --> 00:13:55.615
Ta-da! This one right here.

00:13:55.615 --> 00:13:58.851
Instead of explaining this,

00:13:58.851 --> 00:14:02.221
it's better to just show you.

00:14:03.055 --> 00:14:04.757
Look, everyone.

00:14:04.757 --> 00:14:06.726
I can already feel how moisturizing it is.

00:14:07.226 --> 00:14:08.094
Ta-da.

00:14:12.331 --> 00:14:15.668
Men can be sensitive.

00:14:16.636 --> 00:14:19.005
They can easily get trapped in trauma.

00:14:20.306 --> 00:14:21.874
After one failure,

00:14:21.874 --> 00:14:24.443
they become afraid
of disappointing their wives again.

00:14:24.844 --> 00:14:27.213
So the wife...

00:14:27.213 --> 00:14:30.116
should never yell at him
to get it up immediately...

00:14:30.116 --> 00:14:32.251
or make fun of him.

00:14:37.757 --> 00:14:38.591
Ma'am,

00:14:39.091 --> 00:14:42.094
have you ever shown dissatisfaction...

00:14:42.094 --> 00:14:44.263
when being intimate with your husband?

00:14:45.565 --> 00:14:46.532
Well,

00:14:47.934 --> 00:14:51.938
maybe he might've felt that way.

00:14:56.976 --> 00:14:57.743
Okay.

00:14:58.311 --> 00:15:01.013
Then shall we go...

00:15:01.013 --> 00:15:02.148
to break through that trauma?

00:15:08.521 --> 00:15:10.389
Sir, stand up.

00:15:11.057 --> 00:15:13.426
You have to get out of it on your own.

00:15:13.426 --> 00:15:14.293
You can do it.

00:15:14.861 --> 00:15:15.761
You can do it.

00:15:15.761 --> 00:15:17.129
Now, let's break the mold.

00:15:17.964 --> 00:15:19.632
Sir, stand up.

00:15:20.666 --> 00:15:22.568
You have to stand up on your own.

00:15:22.935 --> 00:15:24.537
You can do it.

00:15:25.805 --> 00:15:29.342
Now, spring up and straighten your back!

00:15:29.642 --> 00:15:30.576
Spring up.

00:15:31.077 --> 00:15:32.278
That's it, good.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.081
One more time.

00:15:35.081 --> 00:15:37.717
- Try again, tighten up.
- I can do it.

00:15:37.717 --> 00:15:39.585
Once more time, on your own.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.754
- Rise up.
- Rise up...

00:15:41.754 --> 00:15:43.723
- Lift yourself up.
- I can do it.

00:15:43.723 --> 00:15:44.824
Rise up.

00:15:44.824 --> 00:15:46.692
- You can do it.
- You can stand.

00:15:46.692 --> 00:15:47.793
You can stand up.

00:15:47.793 --> 00:15:48.828
Honey, I can do it.

00:15:49.295 --> 00:15:50.563
- One more time.
- I can do it, honey.

00:15:50.563 --> 00:15:52.598
Straighten your back.

00:15:52.598 --> 00:15:53.599
Stand tall.

00:15:55.001 --> 00:15:56.936
It's okay. Everyone's like that at first.

00:15:56.936 --> 00:15:57.937
Break, no.

00:15:57.937 --> 00:15:59.238
I mean, break free.

00:15:59.238 --> 00:16:01.040
I want to overcome this.

00:16:03.643 --> 00:16:04.877
- You can do it.
- I can do it.

00:16:06.012 --> 00:16:07.847
Like a cocoon turning into a butterfly.

00:16:08.314 --> 00:16:10.616
- It's okay.
- You're becoming a butterfly now.

00:16:10.616 --> 00:16:12.018
Now, stand up.

00:16:12.018 --> 00:16:13.719
You can do it.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:18.524
No, help me.

00:16:18.524 --> 00:16:19.659
Help me.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.029
All right, let's join forces.

00:16:23.029 --> 00:16:25.064
- Let's help him stand up.
- Okay.

00:16:25.064 --> 00:16:27.266
Now, feel the tremor...

00:16:27.767 --> 00:16:30.336
of overcoming for yourself.

00:16:30.336 --> 00:16:31.204
I can do it.

00:16:31.204 --> 00:16:32.738
- I want to break out of this mold.
- You can do it.

00:16:32.738 --> 00:16:34.140
I want to overcome it.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.241
- I can do it.
- You can do it.

00:16:35.241 --> 00:16:36.275
I can do it!

00:16:36.275 --> 00:16:37.743
Break the mold.

00:16:38.945 --> 00:16:40.246
Break the mold.

00:16:40.246 --> 00:16:41.080
The mold.

00:16:46.586 --> 00:16:47.620
Honey.

00:17:04.003 --> 00:17:04.871
You can go.

00:17:06.005 --> 00:17:08.274
Ask for something for the bruise,
and they'll give it to you.

00:17:08.274 --> 00:17:09.642
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

00:17:09.642 --> 00:17:11.077
No.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.379
You had such a strong will
to overcome it...

00:17:13.379 --> 00:17:14.947
that you got yourself out of it.

00:17:23.322 --> 00:17:27.493
(Pharmacy)

00:17:46.345 --> 00:17:47.146
What is it?

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:48.981
I forgot my wallet.

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.372
Here's your soup.

00:18:13.372 --> 00:18:14.173
Here.

00:18:14.907 --> 00:18:16.075
It won't take long.

00:18:16.075 --> 00:18:17.910
I'll just do a quick round
through the market.

00:18:18.511 --> 00:18:20.680
Mom, sorry, and thanks for helping.

00:18:21.347 --> 00:18:23.282
But after all those years as a show host,

00:18:23.282 --> 00:18:24.917
- you still have to take another test?
- Yeah.

00:18:25.284 --> 00:18:26.719
It's been too long since I quit.

00:18:26.719 --> 00:18:28.087
So if I don't take it,
I can't get back in.

00:18:29.755 --> 00:18:31.157
Go on.

00:18:31.157 --> 00:18:32.358
Mother, I'm here.

00:18:33.459 --> 00:18:34.460
Aunt, I didn't know you were here.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.162
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:18:36.162 --> 00:18:37.964
You're home from work already?

00:18:37.964 --> 00:18:40.032
No, I had to stop by the bank,
so I took half a day off.

00:18:40.933 --> 00:18:42.335
But what brings you here, Aunt?

00:18:43.169 --> 00:18:44.070
Well,

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:47.306
she's doing market research
for a job interview.

00:18:48.407 --> 00:18:50.610
You're getting back to work?

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:53.346
I'm just checking things out for now.

00:18:54.013 --> 00:18:54.847
I see.

00:19:08.594 --> 00:19:09.529
Aunt.

00:19:09.896 --> 00:19:11.831
I'll give you a ride.
Where are you headed?

00:19:11.831 --> 00:19:13.933
That's all right.
It doesn't take long by subway.

00:19:13.933 --> 00:19:14.901
Take care.

00:19:14.901 --> 00:19:15.835
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.074
Wait.

00:19:22.742 --> 00:19:25.178
I know what you're worried about.

00:19:25.178 --> 00:19:27.513
But I'm not asking Mom to babysit.

00:19:27.513 --> 00:19:30.383
And I already hired a nanny.

00:19:30.383 --> 00:19:32.151
That's not what I meant.

00:19:33.119 --> 00:19:35.021
What I'm trying to say is this.

00:19:35.955 --> 00:19:37.990
You've been out of work for six years,

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:39.959
so don't take it lightly,

00:19:39.959 --> 00:19:41.661
and make sure you prepare thoroughly.

00:19:42.562 --> 00:19:45.264
You know how fast
the world moves these days.

00:19:47.066 --> 00:19:47.900
But...

00:19:48.501 --> 00:19:50.670
why do you want to go back to work?

00:19:51.204 --> 00:19:52.305
For the money?

00:19:53.873 --> 00:19:56.175
Of course, that's part of it, but...

00:19:56.175 --> 00:19:58.778
But this only looks nice on the outside.

00:19:58.778 --> 00:20:00.947
Having two incomes doesn't
necessarily mean making more money.

00:20:01.714 --> 00:20:03.783
I support Mother financially.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.118
I even bought her a new fridge recently.

00:20:07.353 --> 00:20:10.022
Sometimes I wonder
if this is really worth it...

00:20:10.923 --> 00:20:12.325
or if I'm actually taking a loss.

00:20:18.498 --> 00:20:19.365
Wait, please.

00:20:55.001 --> 00:20:55.902
Noh Won Bin.

00:20:59.138 --> 00:21:00.573
What on earth is going on?

00:21:01.607 --> 00:21:04.177
Rumor has it that you're
having an affair with Seon Min.

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:05.278
What?

00:21:07.346 --> 00:21:08.114
So...

00:21:09.015 --> 00:21:11.083
please, get a grip...

00:21:11.417 --> 00:21:12.618
and cut things off with her.

00:21:13.853 --> 00:21:15.855
Na Jeong might even get hired soon.

00:21:16.255 --> 00:21:18.057
Do you really want your wife
to see you like this?

00:21:36.742 --> 00:21:37.944
Hey, are the kids asleep?

00:21:38.411 --> 00:21:39.312
Yeah.

00:21:45.051 --> 00:21:45.885
Here.

00:21:47.353 --> 00:21:48.254
What's this?

00:21:49.355 --> 00:21:52.091
I asked around,
and some partner companies are looking...

00:21:52.091 --> 00:21:54.360
for people with
major TV network experience.

00:21:55.127 --> 00:21:57.663
It's not exactly hosting a show
like you want,

00:21:57.663 --> 00:21:59.198
but the work's pretty similar.

00:21:59.398 --> 00:22:01.234
The pay's not bad either, so check it out.

00:22:01.667 --> 00:22:02.468
So what you're saying...

00:22:03.102 --> 00:22:06.506
is that I shouldn't have
the Sweet Home Shopping interview, right?

00:22:06.506 --> 00:22:09.342
They're doing that program
just to please the government.

00:22:09.342 --> 00:22:11.644
Even if you get in, they'll just
treat you like a disposable item.

00:22:11.644 --> 00:22:13.145
So why even bother going there?

00:22:13.145 --> 00:22:14.280
I told you.

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.249
I want to go there
because it's Sweet Home Shopping.

00:22:16.782 --> 00:22:18.584
Even if they abandon me later,

00:22:18.584 --> 00:22:21.721
I want to clear my name.

00:22:21.721 --> 00:22:23.623
I get how you feel, honey,

00:22:23.623 --> 00:22:26.125
but that's meaningless in a company.

00:22:27.026 --> 00:22:28.995
If you look elsewhere,
you'll find something better and...

00:22:28.995 --> 00:22:29.829
No, I don't want to.

00:22:30.296 --> 00:22:32.298
No matter what you say,
I'm having the final interview.

00:22:32.298 --> 00:22:34.300
Why won't you listen to me?

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:35.668
There's nothing good
waiting for you there.

00:22:35.668 --> 00:22:37.637
Why are you so against it?

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:39.872
Is there some reason
I shouldn't go back there?

00:22:41.574 --> 00:22:42.441
What?

00:22:43.643 --> 00:22:45.745
Of course, not.

00:22:46.445 --> 00:22:48.915
I just think
you'll wear yourself out for nothing.

00:22:48.915 --> 00:22:49.782
Wait.

00:22:50.349 --> 00:22:51.484
Is it because you're ashamed of me?

00:22:51.684 --> 00:22:52.585
What?

00:22:52.585 --> 00:22:54.921
Because your wife
who's been out of work for six years,

00:22:54.921 --> 00:22:57.290
is now a middle-aged woman
who's about to work with you,

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:58.691
are you ashamed?

00:22:58.858 --> 00:23:00.860
What are you even talking about?

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.495
Then what is it?

00:23:02.929 --> 00:23:05.097
Why are you so against it?

00:23:05.998 --> 00:23:08.201
Just say it.

00:23:10.102 --> 00:23:11.370
All right, fine.

00:23:12.839 --> 00:23:14.807
Yeah, I'm ashamed, okay?

00:23:19.712 --> 00:23:20.913
I can't even.

00:24:10.329 --> 00:24:12.932
(Enter unlock pattern.)

00:24:25.077 --> 00:24:26.679
This is driving me insane.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:41.761
What's this?

00:25:01.981 --> 00:25:03.015
Get up. Now.

00:25:03.483 --> 00:25:04.417
What?

00:25:04.417 --> 00:25:05.651
I said get up!

00:25:07.119 --> 00:25:07.987
Why?

00:25:09.322 --> 00:25:10.389
What's this?

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:12.191
Who's this for?

00:25:17.697 --> 00:25:18.598
Mom.

00:25:18.865 --> 00:25:19.699
What?

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.236
When I went on that business trip,

00:25:23.236 --> 00:25:25.104
she asked me to secretly buy her...

00:25:25.738 --> 00:25:27.340
some underwear at duty-free.

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:28.975
Do you expect me to believe that?

00:25:29.408 --> 00:25:31.611
Why would your mom wear a thong?

00:25:31.611 --> 00:25:32.245
Honey.

00:25:32.912 --> 00:25:35.314
You shouldn't assume
older women don't wear thongs.

00:25:35.314 --> 00:25:38.151
My mom also has the right
to fulfill her sexual fantasy.

00:25:40.353 --> 00:25:41.320
I was having such a good sleep.

00:25:50.296 --> 00:25:52.798
Did you see Manager Shin's pants today?

00:25:52.798 --> 00:25:53.699
I did.

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:55.334
Red.

00:25:56.135 --> 00:25:57.503
Unbelievable.

00:25:57.503 --> 00:25:59.605
Who wears pants like that at his age?

00:25:59.605 --> 00:26:00.640
Seriously.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.110
But there's something I've been wondering.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:04.911
What is it, Manager Gu?

00:26:05.611 --> 00:26:07.046
Have any of you...

00:26:07.613 --> 00:26:09.715
ever worn a thong?

00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:11.317
A thong?

00:26:11.918 --> 00:26:13.820
No. Are you going to wear one?

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.989
No, not me.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:19.458
I just heard...

00:26:19.458 --> 00:26:21.994
some older people wear them too,

00:26:22.395 --> 00:26:26.199
so I was just curious why.

00:26:27.066 --> 00:26:29.235
I've also heard...

00:26:29.235 --> 00:26:32.471
some people say once they try one,
it's so comfortable...

00:26:32.471 --> 00:26:34.040
that they can't go back...

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.075
to regular underwear.

00:26:36.075 --> 00:26:38.744
Really?

00:26:38.744 --> 00:26:39.879
And...

00:26:43.149 --> 00:26:44.350
What are you doing over there?

00:26:46.953 --> 00:26:49.755
Nothing.

00:26:51.924 --> 00:26:53.459
Please, go on.

00:26:53.726 --> 00:26:54.727
Please.

00:26:58.898 --> 00:26:59.866
Did he hear everything?

00:26:59.866 --> 00:27:00.800
What's with him?

00:27:03.135 --> 00:27:04.203
Yeah, Mom.

00:27:05.271 --> 00:27:06.606
Do you wear thongs too?

00:27:07.773 --> 00:27:08.608
Yeah.

00:27:09.242 --> 00:27:10.376
I heard they're comfortable.

00:27:10.776 --> 00:27:11.878
What's wrong with him?

00:27:19.719 --> 00:27:20.820
What's that?

00:27:21.554 --> 00:27:23.489
Why is someone else's car
parked in my spot?

00:27:31.697 --> 00:27:33.766
That's so rude.

00:27:34.534 --> 00:27:37.737
(Reserved Parking
Car No. 132C 5067)

00:27:37.737 --> 00:27:38.704
Hello?

00:27:39.272 --> 00:27:41.274
Excuse me, could you move your car?

00:27:41.274 --> 00:27:42.642
You're in my parking space.

00:27:42.642 --> 00:27:44.544
Really?

00:27:44.544 --> 00:27:47.013
Can't you just park
somewhere else for now?

00:27:47.013 --> 00:27:48.247
I can't go at the moment.

00:27:48.247 --> 00:27:49.148
Excuse me.

00:27:49.682 --> 00:27:52.552
Why would I park somewhere else
when my spot's right here?

00:27:52.819 --> 00:27:54.954
Come and move your car now.

00:27:55.188 --> 00:27:56.689
How annoying.

00:27:56.923 --> 00:27:57.890
What a hassle.

00:28:00.626 --> 00:28:01.394
What?

00:28:02.628 --> 00:28:04.263
Why is she talking
like her tongue's missing?

00:28:31.491 --> 00:28:32.258
Let's go.

00:28:33.125 --> 00:28:34.026
Let's go.

00:28:35.361 --> 00:28:36.162
Show me cute.

00:28:36.562 --> 00:28:38.531
Cute, yes.

00:28:38.798 --> 00:28:39.799
Sexy.

00:28:40.867 --> 00:28:41.834
Beautiful.

00:28:45.638 --> 00:28:47.240
Deputy Editor.

00:28:50.843 --> 00:28:53.913
So it was you.

00:28:53.913 --> 00:28:57.350
Why were you in such a rush and so angry?

00:28:57.683 --> 00:29:00.153
You scared me half to death earlier.

00:29:00.853 --> 00:29:03.022
Sorry, this is my assigned parking space.

00:29:07.193 --> 00:29:08.961
Honey, wait in the car.

00:29:09.162 --> 00:29:10.029
Okay.

00:29:15.768 --> 00:29:18.704
Actually, I wanted to talk
to the magazine team anyway.

00:29:20.439 --> 00:29:21.541
Mind if I?

00:29:21.541 --> 00:29:22.275
About what?

00:29:22.942 --> 00:29:25.978
I stopped by the salon the other day,

00:29:26.279 --> 00:29:28.815
and happened to see our magazine.

00:29:30.516 --> 00:29:32.852
I was honestly shocked...

00:29:33.319 --> 00:29:34.420
because there was nothing
worth looking at.

00:29:34.687 --> 00:29:36.556
But as you know,
the licensing market these days...

00:29:36.556 --> 00:29:39.392
is shifting toward digital platforms,

00:29:39.392 --> 00:29:41.894
and since the digital team got stronger,
our followers have grown...

00:29:41.894 --> 00:29:42.728
So...

00:29:42.728 --> 00:29:44.397
it's okay for the magazine
to have nothing worth seeing?

00:29:44.397 --> 00:29:45.631
Should we just shut it down, then?

00:29:46.232 --> 00:29:47.433
I'll call my dad.

00:29:48.301 --> 00:29:49.068
Should I?

00:29:49.569 --> 00:29:50.369
Should I?

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.141
Excuse me, Deputy Editor.

00:29:56.275 --> 00:29:57.577
You know why...

00:29:57.577 --> 00:30:00.213
my dad keeps paying
those crazy license fees...

00:30:00.847 --> 00:30:04.283
and lets me run
this unprofitable magazine?

00:30:05.384 --> 00:30:08.454
Probably so he can say we're leading...

00:30:08.821 --> 00:30:10.256
the print-based culture, right?

00:30:10.923 --> 00:30:12.825
But if it doesn't even do that anymore,

00:30:12.825 --> 00:30:14.060
then what's the point?

00:30:14.393 --> 00:30:15.328
It's embarrassing.

00:30:17.063 --> 00:30:18.030
We might as well close it down.

00:30:20.433 --> 00:30:21.601
So please,

00:30:22.435 --> 00:30:23.703
do better.

00:30:24.203 --> 00:30:25.805
Got it?

00:30:26.606 --> 00:30:28.941
In that sense, make a heart.

00:30:30.243 --> 00:30:31.077
No?

00:30:34.547 --> 00:30:35.481
Fine, then.

00:30:36.282 --> 00:30:37.683
Anyway, take care.

00:31:25.398 --> 00:31:26.499
Ta-da.

00:31:26.499 --> 00:31:27.633
Merry Christmas.

00:31:31.037 --> 00:31:34.040
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:34.907
I brought something too.

00:31:35.575 --> 00:31:36.375
For me?

00:31:37.476 --> 00:31:38.644
- Should we open them together?
- Yes.

00:31:38.644 --> 00:31:39.912
One, two, three.

00:31:41.747 --> 00:31:43.549
Il Ri, this is exactly what I wanted.

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:45.251
This must've been expensive.

00:31:46.319 --> 00:31:47.420
What's this?

00:31:49.355 --> 00:31:50.256
This is me,

00:31:50.923 --> 00:31:52.492
and this is you, Il Ri.

00:31:53.559 --> 00:31:54.360
Cute, right?

00:31:58.431 --> 00:31:59.499
(Price 5 dollars)

00:31:59.665 --> 00:32:02.101
How do I look? Does it suit me?

00:32:03.736 --> 00:32:04.604
Yeah, it's cute.

00:33:05.865 --> 00:33:06.766
What the...

00:33:09.836 --> 00:33:10.937
What do you think you're doing?

00:33:31.757 --> 00:33:34.026
Hey! What was that?

00:33:35.728 --> 00:33:36.762
Damn it.

00:33:37.997 --> 00:33:39.866
I didn't kiss her. You saw that, right?

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:41.734
She's the one who kissed me.

00:33:42.535 --> 00:33:43.436
Ma'am.

00:33:44.036 --> 00:33:45.805
You know,

00:33:45.805 --> 00:33:48.140
I dressed him, fed him,
and tucked him in for three years.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.141
Then he dumped me.

00:33:50.109 --> 00:33:52.311
So a goodbye kiss should be allowed.

00:33:52.945 --> 00:33:53.779
Right?

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.402
She's crazy.

00:34:17.336 --> 00:34:19.539
She's totally nuts.

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:23.209
(Green Forest Kindergarten
Thrifty Flea Market)

00:34:25.211 --> 00:34:27.380
Welcome.
Would you like some coffee?

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.749
It's summer,
so have some watermelon juice.

00:34:29.749 --> 00:34:30.850
Have a great day.

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:32.819
Thank you. Bye.

00:34:32.819 --> 00:34:34.020
Bye.

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:34.887
Goodness.

00:34:38.691 --> 00:34:40.593
You look tired today.

00:34:40.593 --> 00:34:41.527
What's wrong?

00:34:41.894 --> 00:34:43.563
I had a fight with my husband yesterday.

00:34:44.197 --> 00:34:44.997
Why?

00:34:45.998 --> 00:34:48.634
He keeps trying to stop me
from having the final interview at Sweet.

00:34:48.634 --> 00:34:50.236
So I asked him why,

00:34:51.137 --> 00:34:52.238
and he said he's embarrassed...

00:34:52.605 --> 00:34:53.840
to work at the same company as me.

00:34:54.106 --> 00:34:56.409
It's not like I wanted to quit my career
and look like this.

00:34:56.409 --> 00:34:58.578
I stepped away for the family,
and he said he was ashamed.

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.015
Hearing that from him...

00:35:03.816 --> 00:35:05.251
just crushed my confidence even more.

00:35:06.185 --> 00:35:07.820
The more I prepare,

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.690
the less I know what I practice with.

00:35:11.357 --> 00:35:13.526
I feel so out of touch
with the trends too.

00:35:13.526 --> 00:35:16.462
But you did so well in the second round.

00:35:17.029 --> 00:35:20.099
Hey, interviews are all about attitude.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.134
That was just luck.

00:35:24.003 --> 00:35:26.572
The world's changed so much in six years,

00:35:27.173 --> 00:35:28.441
but I've just been standing still.

00:35:39.285 --> 00:35:40.419
How much is this?

00:35:40.419 --> 00:35:41.354
That's 50 cents.

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:45.858
I've never seen a black one before.

00:35:46.459 --> 00:35:47.360
This one's 50 cents.

00:35:48.361 --> 00:35:49.262
How much is this?

00:35:49.695 --> 00:35:50.730
- Fifty cents.
- One hundred thousand.

00:35:52.231 --> 00:35:53.065
No, it's not.

00:35:55.968 --> 00:35:58.771
One, two, three, four.

00:35:58.771 --> 00:36:01.807
Okay, that'll be 147 dollars total.

00:36:03.609 --> 00:36:06.312
Maybe it's because of the heat,
but it ended faster than I expected.

00:36:06.312 --> 00:36:07.113
I know, right?

00:36:07.113 --> 00:36:08.681
Then should we start packing up...

00:36:08.681 --> 00:36:10.283
and go see how the kids are doing?

00:36:10.283 --> 00:36:11.083
Sure.

00:36:14.854 --> 00:36:16.255
Mom.

00:36:16.255 --> 00:36:17.089
Ah Young.

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:19.192
What is it, Ah Young?

00:36:19.192 --> 00:36:22.662
- Why are you crying?
- Mom, nobody's buying my scrubbers.

00:36:23.596 --> 00:36:25.832
It's okay.

00:36:25.832 --> 00:36:28.835
Ah Young, how about
we try selling them together now?

00:36:29.669 --> 00:36:31.270
There, there.

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:32.071
Good girl.

00:36:33.039 --> 00:36:34.373
Dish scrubbers for sale.

00:36:34.974 --> 00:36:36.876
My daughter crocheted these herself.

00:36:36.876 --> 00:36:38.511
They sell for three dollars elsewhere,

00:36:38.511 --> 00:36:39.946
but I'll give them to you for just two.

00:36:40.246 --> 00:36:42.982
Take a look at these dish scrubbers.
They're cheap.

00:36:42.982 --> 00:36:44.417
Dish scrubbers for sale.

00:36:44.417 --> 00:36:47.353
They're hand-crocheted scrubbers.

00:36:47.353 --> 00:36:48.387
Come take a look.

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:52.325
What should we do?

00:36:57.763 --> 00:36:58.564
Jin Hee.

00:36:59.131 --> 00:37:00.233
I've got an idea.

00:37:22.155 --> 00:37:24.790
(Don't eat it.
Save it for your dishes.)

00:37:25.525 --> 00:37:26.959
(Ah Young's Rainbow Dish Scrubbers)

00:37:26.959 --> 00:37:28.494
Hello!

00:37:28.494 --> 00:37:31.430
Dear little customers and homemakers,

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:33.065
today I've brought you something...

00:37:33.065 --> 00:37:36.102
you absolutely don't want to miss.

00:37:36.102 --> 00:37:38.137
Dish scrubbers.

00:37:38.137 --> 00:37:39.305
But everyone,

00:37:39.305 --> 00:37:42.375
the regular scrubbers you use at home...

00:37:42.375 --> 00:37:45.211
absorb too much water,

00:37:45.211 --> 00:37:47.180
making them a breeding ground
for bacteria,

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:49.982
and they don't dry well either.

00:37:49.982 --> 00:37:51.551
But how about this one?

00:37:55.888 --> 00:37:57.590
No matter how much you squeeze,
it's the same.

00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:59.525
You waste tons of detergent.

00:37:59.826 --> 00:38:00.827
But...

00:38:00.827 --> 00:38:03.930
this product is different.

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:07.466
It's hand-crocheted,
so it drains water super well.

00:38:07.466 --> 00:38:10.336
Now, let's try scrubbing off
these tough stains.

00:38:13.139 --> 00:38:13.906
Watch this.

00:38:16.943 --> 00:38:18.878
See that?

00:38:18.878 --> 00:38:21.747
Just one quick rinse and it's spotless.

00:38:22.248 --> 00:38:25.518
These pretty,
100 percent hand-crocheted scrubbers...

00:38:25.518 --> 00:38:28.855
are only two dollars each.

00:38:28.855 --> 00:38:30.523
But today only,

00:38:31.524 --> 00:38:34.060
we have a special bundle deal.

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:36.295
A scrubber bun,

00:38:36.929 --> 00:38:37.864
patty,

00:38:38.798 --> 00:38:39.765
cheese,

00:38:40.366 --> 00:38:41.334
lettuce,

00:38:42.134 --> 00:38:43.669
and tomato-.

00:38:43.669 --> 00:38:44.637
Ta-da.

00:38:44.637 --> 00:38:46.806
A full hamburger set.

00:38:46.806 --> 00:38:49.809
Six scrubbers for just 6.9 dollars.

00:38:50.209 --> 00:38:52.311
Cute to look at, and great to use.

00:38:52.545 --> 00:38:55.748
Isn't this practically a steal?

00:38:55.748 --> 00:38:58.551
An amazing chance
to get this 12-dollar original set...

00:38:58.551 --> 00:39:01.154
at an incredible price.

00:39:02.889 --> 00:39:03.823
Here you go.

00:39:04.257 --> 00:39:06.292
Thank you.

00:39:06.292 --> 00:39:07.059
Yes.

00:39:07.059 --> 00:39:08.261
Thank you.

00:39:08.995 --> 00:39:10.062
Thank you.

00:39:11.964 --> 00:39:12.899
Sorry.

00:39:14.934 --> 00:39:16.602
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:39:16.602 --> 00:39:18.137
Would you like two?

00:39:20.039 --> 00:39:22.108
Here you go, thank you.

00:39:22.108 --> 00:39:23.075
Yes, take care.

00:39:27.213 --> 00:39:29.182
- Here you go, thank you.
- Yes.

00:39:29.916 --> 00:39:32.552
Mom, can I go to the playground
with Ah Young?

00:39:32.552 --> 00:39:33.586
Sure, go ahead.

00:39:33.586 --> 00:39:35.288
- Let's go, Ah Young.
- Okay, have fun.

00:39:37.623 --> 00:39:39.258
Thanks, Na Jeong.

00:39:39.258 --> 00:39:40.526
You did great, Jin Hee.

00:39:40.526 --> 00:39:43.362
Thanks to you, Ah Young is smiling again.

00:39:43.963 --> 00:39:46.966
But are you really a show host
who's been out for six years?

00:39:46.966 --> 00:39:49.435
You look ready to sell everything out
starting tomorrow.

00:39:49.435 --> 00:39:50.837
You're flattering me.

00:39:50.837 --> 00:39:54.006
And because you're speaking
from experience,

00:39:54.006 --> 00:39:55.808
it really hits home.

00:39:55.808 --> 00:39:56.909
I see.

00:40:22.034 --> 00:40:22.969
Honey, I'm home.

00:40:22.969 --> 00:40:25.071
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:40:25.071 --> 00:40:27.139
- Min Woo, Dad's home.
- Dad's home.

00:40:28.841 --> 00:40:30.076
What are you doing?

00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:33.746
Alkaline soaps are bad
for Min Woo's eczema, right?

00:40:33.746 --> 00:40:36.849
But the mild ones in stores
are so expensive,

00:40:36.849 --> 00:40:38.251
so I thought I'd try making some myself.

00:40:41.287 --> 00:40:43.089
Honey, look here.

00:40:44.423 --> 00:40:47.093
Don't film me.
I haven't even washed up yet.

00:40:47.093 --> 00:40:48.761
You still look beautiful anyway.

00:40:48.761 --> 00:40:49.595
Come on, look here.

00:40:49.595 --> 00:40:50.663
Stop.

00:40:50.897 --> 00:40:51.797
Wait.

00:40:53.366 --> 00:40:55.034
One, two, three.

00:41:35.842 --> 00:41:37.577
Eom Jong Do.

00:41:38.511 --> 00:41:40.112
You bastard.

00:42:05.238 --> 00:42:06.906
What's wrong with you?

00:42:06.906 --> 00:42:07.907
Where have you been?

00:42:08.541 --> 00:42:09.642
Why do you care?

00:42:11.377 --> 00:42:13.012
You were with her, weren't you?

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.282
What are you talking about?

00:42:16.282 --> 00:42:17.450
I saw everything.

00:42:18.618 --> 00:42:19.986
You kissing that woman.

00:42:23.456 --> 00:42:25.091
Who I kiss or who I marry.

00:42:25.091 --> 00:42:26.459
What's that got to do with you?

00:42:26.959 --> 00:42:28.327
You're the one
who dumped me out of nowhere.

00:42:28.327 --> 00:42:30.029
And now you're suddenly acting
like my wife?

00:42:30.029 --> 00:42:31.664
Don't you think that's a bit ridiculous?

00:42:31.664 --> 00:42:33.166
You pushed me into it.

00:42:33.633 --> 00:42:35.535
You made me say "Let's break up."

00:42:36.502 --> 00:42:38.571
How long has it even been
since we split up?

00:42:38.971 --> 00:42:40.273
And you're already seeing someone else?

00:42:41.607 --> 00:42:43.042
Were you with her...

00:42:43.409 --> 00:42:45.111
while you were still seeing me?

00:42:45.545 --> 00:42:47.446
Does that even matter now?

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.948
Of course, it does.

00:42:50.516 --> 00:42:52.552
It matters, you bastard.

00:42:52.552 --> 00:42:54.620
Why are you being so pathetic?

00:42:55.888 --> 00:42:56.756
What?

00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:58.858
Pathetic?

00:43:00.226 --> 00:43:02.995
Yeah. I've wanted to break up
with you for a long time.

00:43:03.296 --> 00:43:04.197
You know why?

00:43:04.197 --> 00:43:05.798
Because I know you wanted to marry me.

00:43:05.798 --> 00:43:07.733
But didn't we agree not to put
that kind of pressure on each other?

00:43:08.301 --> 00:43:10.436
Why do you always say one thing
and act another way?

00:43:12.238 --> 00:43:13.306
You know I'm not the kind of guy...

00:43:13.306 --> 00:43:15.274
who can give you that kind of life.

00:43:15.274 --> 00:43:16.409
So find someone...

00:43:16.409 --> 00:43:18.444
who can do that for you.

00:43:38.698 --> 00:43:39.599

00:44:08.261 --> 00:44:09.228
Go.

00:44:10.463 --> 00:44:14.867
(Who will Man no. 4 choose?)

00:44:14.867 --> 00:44:17.803
Now, ladies, please turn around.

(Woman no. 1 gets to dine with two men.)

00:44:25.077 --> 00:44:29.015
(Then, what about Woman no. 2?)

00:44:29.315 --> 00:44:30.149
(Correct guess, Man no. 3)

00:44:33.219 --> 00:44:35.087
(Man no. 4 chooses Woman no. 4.)

00:44:35.087 --> 00:44:37.056

and cozy lunch date.)

I really love figures.

00:44:42.395 --> 00:44:43.596
This looks so good.

(The lonely one, Woman no. 3)

Woman no. 3 eats

Even now, she's still hungry.

00:44:55.942 --> 00:44:58.611
Why is single life...

00:44:58.611 --> 00:45:00.179
so miserable?

00:45:01.614 --> 00:45:02.615
In the end,

00:45:02.615 --> 00:45:04.884
Woman no. 3 bursts into tears.

00:45:05.384 --> 00:45:08.287
She wishes she could erase...

00:45:08.287 --> 00:45:09.455
the memory of clinging and crying.

00:45:09.689 --> 00:45:11.457
Can we not talk about that?

00:45:13.359 --> 00:45:15.728
It's not like I went there
to act desperate.

00:45:15.728 --> 00:45:16.929
But it seems...

00:45:16.929 --> 00:45:19.131
you put a bit too much pressure
on Man no. 4.

00:45:19.832 --> 00:45:21.934
That's a strange way to put it.

00:45:22.468 --> 00:45:25.304
So what,
the cheating jerk isn't the problem,

00:45:25.304 --> 00:45:27.073
but I am, for pressuring him?

00:45:27.907 --> 00:45:30.476
Unbelievable. Do you even hear yourself?

00:45:30.476 --> 00:45:32.245
No, what I meant was...

00:45:32.245 --> 00:45:33.145
Forget it.

00:45:34.213 --> 00:45:37.216
I don't want to talk to someone like you,

00:45:37.216 --> 00:45:39.919
trying to gaslight me
with that twisted logic.

00:45:39.919 --> 00:45:41.287
I'm done with this interview.

00:45:41.287 --> 00:45:42.922
Cut all my footage.

00:45:42.922 --> 00:45:43.956
I'm afraid that's not possible.

00:45:45.158 --> 00:45:46.959
What do you mean, not possible?

00:45:47.493 --> 00:45:48.828
You're going to edit it
the way you want...

00:45:48.828 --> 00:45:50.530
and ruin my life, aren't you?

00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:52.498
Go ahead and try it.
I'll destroy all of you.

00:45:53.699 --> 00:45:56.402
I said stop filming!
Why are you still filming?

00:45:57.403 --> 00:45:58.638

Goodness.

00:47:11.611 --> 00:47:13.613
You must be really stressed right now.

00:47:16.682 --> 00:47:17.783
This part...

00:47:17.783 --> 00:47:19.619
is stiff as a rock.

It seems like you're going through
something tough,

but once it's over,

00:47:24.624 --> 00:47:25.992
you'll see it wasn't such a big deal.

Try not to stress too much.

00:47:28.961 --> 00:47:31.497
This won't do. Turn over for a second.

00:47:39.472 --> 00:47:41.107
It seems you've lost
your emotional strength as well.

00:47:45.144 --> 00:47:45.978
Wait.

00:47:46.546 --> 00:47:47.380

00:47:57.223 --> 00:47:57.990
Hey.

00:48:00.359 --> 00:48:02.528
Hey, are you okay?

00:48:03.629 --> 00:48:06.299

Here.

Mom, why do you look so pretty today?

00:48:15.408 --> 00:48:16.442
Really? Do I?

00:48:16.442 --> 00:48:17.844
Yeah, super pretty.

00:48:19.011 --> 00:48:20.513
That's a relief.

00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:23.816
It's a really, really important day today,

00:48:23.816 --> 00:48:25.585
so I have to look extra pretty.

00:48:26.319 --> 00:48:27.186

00:48:41.868 --> 00:48:44.904
Everyone, do you know
what the hottest material is these days?

00:48:44.904 --> 00:48:46.772
It's vegan leather.

00:48:46.772 --> 00:48:48.608
Yes, it's a cruelty-free...

00:48:48.608 --> 00:48:51.110
yet luxurious like real leather.

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:53.312
But it's not just the material
that's special.

00:48:53.312 --> 00:48:54.914
Take a look at this wallet.

00:48:54.914 --> 00:48:56.883
See how it fits perfectly...

00:48:56.883 --> 00:48:58.484
in your hand.

00:48:58.484 --> 00:48:59.585
And right here,

00:48:59.585 --> 00:49:02.822
it has an incredible number of card slots.
Seven, seven, fourteen in total.

00:49:02.822 --> 00:49:04.524
Your coins, bills, and receipts.

00:49:04.524 --> 00:49:06.259
You can neatly organize them.

00:49:06.259 --> 00:49:09.095
Personally, it's frustrating
when I can't see everything at a glance.

00:49:09.095 --> 00:49:12.165
But with this one, just open it up
and everything's right there.

00:49:12.165 --> 00:49:15.067
You'll find yourself saying,
"Is this really at this price?"

00:49:15.067 --> 00:49:17.136
I guarantee it.

00:49:17.136 --> 00:49:19.071
And take a look at this design.

00:49:19.071 --> 00:49:22.208
It's smooth with a subtle sheen,

00:49:22.208 --> 00:49:23.910
making it look sophisticated...

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:26.245
with both casual and formal outfits.

00:49:26.245 --> 00:49:28.381
The color tone is calm and refined,

00:49:28.381 --> 00:49:30.783
so it makes a perfect gift as well.

00:49:30.783 --> 00:49:33.052
When our parents travel,

00:49:33.052 --> 00:49:35.154
they always have coins
and receipts piling up, right?

00:49:35.154 --> 00:49:36.355
They'll really find this useful.

00:49:36.355 --> 00:49:39.292
It's also great for a friend's birthday,
or even as a gift for your boss.

00:49:39.292 --> 00:49:41.894

a little too much like a mom?

She's been one for six years.

00:50:12.725 --> 00:50:14.060
Hello, everyone.

00:50:14.494 --> 00:50:16.662
The product I'll be introducing today...

00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:18.564
is this one right here.

00:50:19.031 --> 00:50:22.301
Some of you might be thinking,

00:50:22.301 --> 00:50:24.804
"I've never seen that before."

00:50:25.271 --> 00:50:26.472
Of course, you haven't.

00:50:26.472 --> 00:50:27.940
That's because...

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:30.710
this is a handmade soap
I personally created...

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:32.345
with my own know-how.

00:50:32.879 --> 00:50:34.847
What, even soap now?

00:50:34.847 --> 00:50:37.250
You might think I've gone too far.

00:50:38.985 --> 00:50:41.053
But actually, my first son...

00:50:41.687 --> 00:50:45.191
suffered from severe eczema
when he was little.

00:50:46.058 --> 00:50:47.860
What? Eczema?

00:50:48.261 --> 00:50:49.762
If you're going to use
your kid's illness as an excuse,

00:50:49.762 --> 00:50:51.197
you might as well quit.

00:50:52.365 --> 00:50:54.834
I tried every folk remedy there was,

00:50:54.834 --> 00:50:56.903
and every moisturizer under the sun.

00:50:57.336 --> 00:51:01.240
But the one thing
that made the biggest difference...

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:03.709
was switching soaps.

00:51:04.443 --> 00:51:07.547
What's the most important part
of treating atopic skin?

00:51:07.547 --> 00:51:09.348
Moisture.

00:51:10.082 --> 00:51:13.186
You all know
we have slightly acidic skin, right?

00:51:13.186 --> 00:51:15.988
But most soaps we use...

00:51:15.988 --> 00:51:17.890
are alkaline.

00:51:18.257 --> 00:51:20.693
And that's terrible for the skin.

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:24.564
The natural oils on your face
that shine...

00:51:24.964 --> 00:51:29.302
is actually a protective layer.

00:51:29.302 --> 00:51:32.672
But alkaline soaps strip it all away.

00:51:33.172 --> 00:51:36.509
You should never use soaps like that.

00:51:36.909 --> 00:51:39.145
No matter how good your moisturizer is,

00:51:39.145 --> 00:51:42.648
if you wash with an alkaline soap,

00:51:42.648 --> 00:51:44.884
it's all wasted effort.

00:51:45.351 --> 00:51:49.889
To the moms struggling
with your children's eczema,

00:51:49.889 --> 00:51:52.625

So, I proudly present
this revolutionary product,

00:51:54.327 --> 00:51:56.596
this handmade soap,

00:51:56.596 --> 00:52:00.032
crafted with a mother's heart.

00:52:01.968 --> 00:52:03.836
That concludes my presentation.

00:52:04.904 --> 00:52:06.239
Good job.

00:52:06.239 --> 00:52:07.106
But...

00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:09.842
did you intentionally go light
on the makeup...

00:52:10.176 --> 00:52:11.878
and skip your nails today?

00:52:11.878 --> 00:52:16.015
Well, appearance is important
for a show host,

00:52:16.015 --> 00:52:19.185
but I believe the concept
should change depending on the product.

00:52:19.552 --> 00:52:21.921
I also wanted to come across...

00:52:21.921 --> 00:52:23.489
as a warm, approachable neighbor.

00:52:26.025 --> 00:52:27.026
Still,

00:52:27.426 --> 00:52:30.096
compared to the younger
and trendier candidates,

00:52:30.096 --> 00:52:32.064
don't you think
you might lack some competitiveness?

00:52:32.465 --> 00:52:34.267
How do you see that?

00:52:35.635 --> 00:52:36.435
Well,

00:52:37.203 --> 00:52:40.173
I don't think
having more life experience...

00:52:40.173 --> 00:52:42.175
is a disadvantage for a show host.

00:52:43.142 --> 00:52:45.178
If anything,
it allows for genuine storytelling...

00:52:45.178 --> 00:52:47.880
that comes from real experience.
