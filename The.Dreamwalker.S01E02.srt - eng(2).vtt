00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.880
Let me trade something with you.

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:44.119
What do you want to trade?

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:46.240
I'll trade the kidnapper's head

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.200
for the head on your table.

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:50.599
You wicked child, courting death.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.560
Yiru.

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:55.319
Little girl.

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:59.159
What if I don't want to trade?

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.520
He doesn't want to trade.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.439
Prince, be careful!

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.680
What are you trying to do?

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.599
Let go of the Prince!

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:10.000
Miss.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.239
Showing up now to rob the execution ground—

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.760
isn't it a bit late?

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.400
He Fuyi from Zhenhuan Biaoju.

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:18.680
Entrusted by someone.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.160
Here to collect Liu Chunru's body.

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:22.839
If you want this noble to stay safe,

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:24.839
then don't make any rash moves.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.360
Aqi.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.400
Come here.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.720
Don't move.

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:48.680
Prince.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.480
Are you tired of living?

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.400
Kidnapping a royal in public—

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:54.360
do you want your whole clan executed?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.319
This is the Old Buddha's direct decree.

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:58.720
A rebel to be beheaded and displayed.

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:00.839
You dare defy the edict to collect her body?

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:03.000
I'm just a courier.

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:04.279
Entrusted by someone.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.199
Everyone, make way.

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:09.360
Let us leave.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.399
I guarantee your Prince

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:12.520
will return safely.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.960
This Zhenhuan Biaoju she mentioned—

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.880
sounds familiar.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.240
Sir, please judge wisely.

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:36.919
Zhenhuan Biaoju

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.039
was once the top escort agency.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.479
But ten years ago,

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:42.880
the whole family was slaughtered overnight.

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:44.240
And their head

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.600
was surnamed He.

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:49.520
You mean to say

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:51.320
the Prince discovered something

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.639
and wants to shake us off?

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.520
He's just a royal hostage.

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:59.199
He has no standing at court.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.880
No matter what,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.520
send word to our master first.

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.320
Say Little Fifth Lord was kidnapped.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.600
The situation has changed.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.360
Also report about Zhenhuan Biaoju.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.039
How are you holding up?

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:17.440
Can you still manage?

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:26.320
Good thing Yun Yi gave you

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.199
these painkillers.

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:31.279
We must break Liu Chunru's obsession soon.

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:33.320
Or I really can't hold on.

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:35.039
We're running out of lamp oil too.

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:36.600
I'll return to the lamp first.

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:38.600
But what about him?

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:40.639
Forget it.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.800
Just leave him here.

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:43.000
Tell me,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.919
who would take Liu Chunru's body?

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:49.279
No clue.

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:51.240
Let's enter the dream again.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.279
What dream?

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.720
Where's this smoke from?

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.000
How could you enter the Seven Stars Dream?

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.279
There's a ghost!

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:18.600
What's going on?

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.519
Where's the guillotine from before?

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.679
Where's Liu Chunru?

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:23.720
He really entered the dream.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.679
No one else has ever entered the Seven Stars Dream.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.720
He Fuyi.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.920
What should we do now?

00:04:29.239 --> 00:04:29.880
Perfect timing.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.200
This is a good place to silence you.

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:32.200
No, no, no!

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.640
No need for that.

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:34.079
It's just a dream.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.799
Stop pretending.

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:38.279
I know you were never unconscious.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.200
The Prince from the capital—

00:04:40.799 --> 00:04:41.600
this noble—

00:04:42.359 --> 00:04:44.119
what do you really want with me?

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.720
I wasn't unconscious.

00:04:46.359 --> 00:04:47.440
But I did fall asleep.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.600
I rushed here day and night from the capital.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.239
Haven't slept for days.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.239
I'm exhausted.

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.720
Enough nonsense.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.440
No, no!

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.959
Chief He, I'm here to discuss a partnership.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.079
To be honest,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.640
I came south this time

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.959
the execution was just incidental.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.160
The real reason

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.679
is a secret order from the inner court.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.880
But

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.000
too many people are watching me.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.239
Far too many.

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:13.959
So last night you used us to shake off surveillance.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.440
Fine.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.559
We used you to escape too.

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:19.359
We're even.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.279
You can go.

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:31.079
I'm not finished yet.

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:32.559
Head He.

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:34.519
I'm unfamiliar with this place.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.720
Could you guide me a bit further?

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.799
Not interested.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.079
You're looking for Liu Chunru's body, right?

00:05:51.799 --> 00:05:53.440
He's lying, isn't he?

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.119
Maybe.

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:56.359
Then why bring him along?

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.799
If he's set on following us,

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.320
even if we ditch him,

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:01.720
he'll sneak after us anyway.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.880
Better to keep him in sight.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.559
I'd like to see

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:07.000
what he really wants.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.600
Besides,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.839
he can enter the Seven Stars Dream.

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:12.559
You two,

00:06:12.799 --> 00:06:14.200
do you have to be so honest?

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.959
I'm still sitting outside.

00:06:17.799 --> 00:06:18.679
Great!

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:21.040
Things just got more interesting.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.760
Aqi.

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:22.839
Go back into the lamp.

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:26.640
Hyah!

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.160
This is a girls' school.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.839
You go in first.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.239
Hand—

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.839
grabbed me.

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:16.440
Why are you so jumpy?

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:16.959
Really—

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.880
That paper figure came alive!

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:33.880
Head He.

00:07:34.799 --> 00:07:35.440
Must've seen wrong.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.519
Just a bit nervous.

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:37.799
Don't try any tricks.

00:07:38.359 --> 00:07:39.839
Careful, or I'll really kill you.

00:08:06.359 --> 00:08:07.200
This girls' school

00:08:07.679 --> 00:08:09.000
Many people died here years ago.

00:08:09.559 --> 00:08:10.720
If you're this scared,

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.920
why did you bring me here?

00:08:13.239 --> 00:08:14.880
I suspect the haunting at the yamen

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.799
is connected to this place.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.519
We might find some clues.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.399
Maybe.

00:08:19.119 --> 00:08:20.399
I don't have time to waste with you.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:21.920
Definitely.

00:08:22.399 --> 00:08:23.399
We'll definitely find clues.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.440
Chief He

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.359
My life is in your hands now.

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:28.720
Calm down, will you?

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.440
These are

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.559
the girls who died back then.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.359
This school promoted new learning.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.200
It threatened too many people's interests.

00:08:51.159 --> 00:08:52.000
In this world,

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:54.280
there's still no place for them.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.479
Who?

00:09:04.599 --> 00:09:05.400
Chief He

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.080
Why don't we find a Taoist priest?

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.239
I heard

00:09:08.239 --> 00:09:09.679
restless ghosts

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.200
all hang upside down

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.039
and hop around.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.119
This sound...

00:09:13.599 --> 00:09:14.599
Could it really be

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.239
Liu Chunru?

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.440
Let go!

00:09:30.559 --> 00:09:31.880
You think you can help me find someone?

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.760
Don't hold me back.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.479
Chief He

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.679
I'm worried about your safety.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.119
She's here to take your head.

00:09:36.239 --> 00:09:36.919
Let go.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.000
Chief He

00:09:39.239 --> 00:09:40.520
I'm worried about your safety.
