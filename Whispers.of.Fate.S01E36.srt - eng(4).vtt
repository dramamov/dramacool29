[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.940
[Episode 36]

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.310
Why did you

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.910
join the Sword Alliance?

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.950
Did Ghostly Peony send you here?

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.370
Mr. Tang, you jest.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.789
Why mention

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.070
the deceased?

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.789
What was Ghostly Peony

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:45.950
to you?

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.150
Enemy,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.570
benefactor,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.070
master,

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.900
and mortal foe.

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.000
So complicated.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.190
I wish I'd been the one who killed him.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.500
How can you prove your innocence?

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.170
The innocent need no defense.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.070
That saying

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.510
doesn't apply to you.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.880
Miss, you attacked so suddenly—

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.340
what exactly do you want?

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.520
Just showing concern for a fellow member.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.090
After today's test,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.940
I can see that your power

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.680
has indeed fully recovered.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.310
This is truly fortunate
for the Sword Alliance.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.710
Then you should also know

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.390
that since I am

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.020
competing for Sword Master,

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.720
I'll

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.720
stop at nothing to succeed.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.210
It's getting late.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.470
I

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.250
won't keep you any longer.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.310
Her cultivation technique

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.370
can actually affect my Tianren body.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.480
Saving Chi Yun

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.090
cannot be delayed any longer.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.850
But now

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.870
the Sword Alliance is in chaos.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.520
Now, the poison pill crisis
has resurfaced.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.630
What the alliance needs

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.680
is someone who can properly handle

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.520
it.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.520
Mr. Tang, your martial arts skills

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.050
are unmatched in the world.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.750
But in this matter,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.850
you're still

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.900
no match for me.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.960
There is another person
in the Sword Alliance.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.570
She is perfect for this.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.630
Enchantress, still trying to escape?

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.630
Stop right there!

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.740
I'll try this way, then.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:17.920
Master Cheng.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.790
You're in quite a hurry.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.040
Where are you heading?

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.720
I just ran into

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.950
an enchantress from Fengliu Shop.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:27.630
I saw her

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.830
running down the mountain.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:29.430
But after chasing her for a while,

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.430
she disappeared.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.980
Down the mountain?

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.310
But this isn't the path down the mountain.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.130
She must have gone far by now.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.210
Tomorrow I'll inform the Service Hall

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.000
to assign a disciple

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.800
to assist you personally, Master Cheng.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.659
How about that?

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.510
Trying to win me over, are you?

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.040
Mr. Tang,

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.310
I didn’t expect you to start using

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.570
Xifang Tao's methods.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.390
But any kindness from either of you

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.320
is unnecessary.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.000
The vote in my hand

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.250
won't go to anyone,

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.690
including myself.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.750
Don't worry, Master Cheng.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:58.600
I

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.530
am not here to ask for your vote,

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.860
but for another matter.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.670
Camellia Island has been imprisoning

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.510
many followers of Yique Yinyang.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.050
Even after more than 10 years,

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.250
they're still alive.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.190
So, Master Cheng,

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.920
you must be well-versed

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.600
in treating poisoned people.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.810
To establish her image, Xifang Tao is

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.270
ruthless in dealing with those

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.600
who have taken the poison pill.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.800
I don't want to see them die needlessly.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.510
Young Lord Yu

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.180
has already returned to Sword King City.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.980
I hope

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.310
you

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.270
can help

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.050
and work with Young Lord Yu

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.310
to establish a shelter in Sword King City

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.840
for those who are poisoned.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.159
The old, weak, sick, and disabled

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:33.560
can all take refuge there

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.210
and find temporary safety.

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:37.460
Once the antidote is developed,

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.070
I'll

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.390
send it to Sword King City as well.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.520
There's an antidote

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.650
for the poison pill?

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.710
There will be one in the future.

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.750
Mr. Tang.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.830
You never used to

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:48.760
explain so much.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:55.610
Because...

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.770
I've discovered

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.630
that not being misunderstood

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:01.800
by people like you

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.180
is actually a good thing.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.870
With your experience

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.220
and Sword King City's help,

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.480
those who are poisoned

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.640
will be safe for now.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.480
After I ask Senior Shui Duopo

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.610
to create the antidote,

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.870
I'll immediately set out to find Chi Yun.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.560
The person Cheng Yunpao was chasing

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.360
was you.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.370
This can heal your internal injuries.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.800
You came here—

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.240
did something happen to Liu Yan?

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.050
He's gone.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:56.560
Ever since we escaped

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.040
from Shen Langhun...

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.240
he's become a completely different person.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.270
We hid in

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.470
a thatched cottage in the countryside.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.120
He spent day and night

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.650
immersed in medical texts.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.820
Yan.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.510
The meal is ready.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:25.800
Why don't you try

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.700
a fruit first?

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.520
Let's eat.

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:39.760
Let's eat.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.190
Master.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:49.720
I heard Tang Lici

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.159
destroyed the Plum Garden

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:52.890
and eliminated Ghostly Peony.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.590
It's not safe outside now.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:55.480
We should stay here

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.600
and hide for a while.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.860
Once your wounds heal,

00:07:58.159 --> 00:07:58.750
I believe

00:07:58.870 --> 00:07:59.390
we'll

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.560
rise again one day.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.730
Ghostly Peony deserved to die.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.960
Don't call me "Master" anymore.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.170
The Master of Fengliu Shop is dead.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.080
From now on, I'm just Liu Yan.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.650
I asked him what exactly he wanted to do.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.520
He only said he was wrong.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:16.990
You told him

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:18.850
that his life...

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.170
Your life is mine to take.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:22.980
Now I want you to live.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.600
Live and slowly

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.800
atone for all the evil

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:26.750
you've done.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.310
He said only by developing

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:31.070
the antidote

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.770
would he have the courage
to face Fang Zhou.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.270
Until this morning...

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.669
I heard

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:38.150
that the Sword Alliance has issued

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.950
a warrant for a man named Liu Yan.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:41.720
They say he created

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.919
the Blood Ghost Pill.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.000
The two of us rarely

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.750
leave home,

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.150
so I don't know much about
what's happening outside.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.720
Then...

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:49.910
did they mention

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.240
what Liu Yan looks like?

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.680
They didn't give a clear description.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.720
But there are

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.600
wanted posters everywhere.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.200
I can't read,

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.540
so I only know what others have told me.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.600
They say a new wave of the poison scourge
has begun

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.480
and that the notorious Liu Yan is
behind it once again.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.550
The Central Plains Sword Alliance's

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:03.630
heroine, Xifang—or something like that—

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.030
is calling on everyone
to actively provide leads.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:06.510
Miss.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.320
You're educated.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.440
Why don't you come with me
to check it out?

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:10.900
Come on.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.550
Let's go.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.480
I was worried he'd act impulsively

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.900
and seek revenge against Xifang Tao,

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.120
so I came here.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.280
At this moment,

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.220
he wouldn't come here.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:24.110
Then where would he go?

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.080
Heartbreak Grass,

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:30.790
Wanli Weed,

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.150
and Midday Moon Herb...

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.720
Herbs...

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.600
I need herbs!

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:36.000
Look!

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:37.390
Isn't that the notorious leader
of Fengliu Shop,

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:37.870
Liu Yan?

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.720
That's right!

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.810
I'd recognize him
even if he turned to ashes!

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:40.310
Get him!

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:46.870
Liu Yan!

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.240
You've brought chaos to the world
with your heinous deeds!

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.720
How dare you show your face?

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.240
Fengliu Shop massacred
my entire Ziyang Sect—

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.170
only I survived!

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.840
My master and elder brother

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.720
were brutally killed by you
in Bohai County!

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.000
The disciples of Jianchi Sect
and Badao Manor

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.390
had their powers drained by Yu Qifeng—

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.790
all because of you!

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.200
The Sword Alliance has issued

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.960
a warrant for a man named Liu Yan.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.120
They say he created

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.320
the Blood Ghost Pill.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:08.340
It was me.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.080
They say a new wave of the poison scourge
has begun...

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:11.610
It was me!

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.360
And that the notorious Liu Yan is
behind it once again.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.440
Still me...

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:16.870
You will

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.750
die here tonight!

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:19.720
Kill him!

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.630
Anyone who stops me from finding the herbs

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:29.750
deserves to die!

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.570
You brought this upon yourselves!

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.530
No!

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.000
Run...

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:57.270
Let's go.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.010
All of you, get out of here.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:02.730
I don't want to hurt you...

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.750
He's gone mad.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:05.600
He's gone mad!

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.910
Please cherish your hands.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.580
They're very precious to me.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.990
My hands are for healing and saving lives,

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.770
not for killing!

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:41.270
Look.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.240
He's about to die from the poison!

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.150
Serves him right!

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:45.810
-He deserves to die!
-Indeed!

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:46.480
Yes!

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.270
Why are you all still standing here?

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.070
If I explode from the poison,

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:53.630
none of you will survive...

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:30.150
He's dead?

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:31.390
Now that he's dead,

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.110
his body won't explode, right?

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:34.240
Let's take his body

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.320
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.720
I heard there's a bounty.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:38.920
Let's go!

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.120
Yan.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:49.840
Yan!

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.150
Yan, wake up,

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.910
Yan.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.200
He took the Blood Ghost Pill.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.080
He's testing the poison on himself.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.200
Yan.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.100
Liu Yan.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.320
The very thing

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.270
you created nearly killed you.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:14.550
Tell me, aren't you

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.210
the biggest fool in the world?

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.840
Master,

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.180
don't leave me alone.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.250
Get off him first.

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.210
Heartbreak Grass,

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:06.360
Wanli Weed,

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.200
and Midday Moon Herb...

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.240
I have all those

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.200
in my room.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.240
Quick!

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:14.000
Catch him!

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:15.720
Hurry!

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:16.250
Get him!

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:16.880
Quick!

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:17.870
Yan,

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:18.870
run!

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.700
Don't let Yique Yinyang's men catch you!

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:22.440
Run!

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.730
That silhouette...

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:39.910
How did I...

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:53.240
Yan.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.440
Are you going out to collect herbs?

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:01.000
Come on.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:02.100

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.080

Give me your herb basket.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:05.340

I should wake up now.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:38.590
You're awake?

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.240
You took too many Blood Ghost Pills.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.600
Testing poison on yourself—

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.800
aren't you afraid...

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.150
the poison will kill you

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:56.270
before you even manage to

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:57.390
develop an antidote?

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:58.270
If you die,

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.240
no one can undo the disaster
you've caused.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:02.920
Have you ever thought about

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.140
how this would end?

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:26.109
You were wounded
by my Thousand Curse Needle.

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:29.840
All your organs are damaged,
leaving your qi and blood in disarray.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.200
Have you thought about your own ending?

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:33.640
It has nothing to do with you.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.640
The Blood Ghost Pill

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.000
is the evil thing I created,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.440
and so is the Thousand Curse Needle.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.400
How can it have nothing to do with me?

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.060
Take away the Rebirth Scroll.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:42.940
The sins I cannot atone for—

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.140
at least you can atone for them.

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.050
If I take the Rebirth Scroll away,

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.460
you'll die.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:00.760
Sit up properly.

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.550
You must stay alive.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:12.350
From now on, the herbs you need

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:13.580
to develop the antidote

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.110
will be delivered regularly.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:16.000
Right now, all the sects in the jianghu

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.130
are hunting for you.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.120
Hide here and stay safe.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.720
I used to think you were clever,

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.720
just a bit unhinged.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.690
But now I see

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.160
you're not only a madman

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.720
but also a fool.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:40.550
Everyone wants me dead,

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.240
yet here you are,
shielding me at great risk

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:42.970
to yourself.

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:44.000
Aren't you afraid you’ll

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:44.790
end up standing alone

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.990
against the entire martial arts world?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.160
I don't care.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:52.590
Yes.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.170
You don't care about anything.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.930
You don't care about your own life,

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.960
so what right do you have to arrange
other people's lives?

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.160
What makes you think you

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.110
can control everything

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.510
and bear all burdens?

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.750
Because I'm Tang Lici!

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.420
You haven't eaten all day.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.810
I made something tasty.

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.310
It's just a bit burnt.

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.550
Mr. Tang, won't you stay for dinner?

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:29.350
No thanks.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.570
Take good care of my senior.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:34.550
Every evening after dinner,

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:35.980
give him one of the pills

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.350
I left for him.

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:41.920
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.960
What?

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.240
You find him very likable

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.150
and responsible, don't you?

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.190
I'm laughing because you two

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.000
are actually very similar deep down.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.530
Why is it that when you meet,

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:04.080
you can't say a single nice word
to each other?

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:05.370
I'm nothing like him.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.310
Time to eat.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.990
I'll take

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:13.970
this medicine before meals.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.250
Why did you save me?

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:43.160
Delicate as a lotus on the outside,
strong as jade within—

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.270
that is the daughter of the Bai family.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:47.000
So how could I let your life be wasted?

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.160
Fengliu Shop is full of hidden talents.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.680
Who is controlling the situation,

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.550
and who is

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.080
the hidden player pulling the strings—

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.940
outsiders have no way of knowing.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:56.590
You want me

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:58.360
to assume a new identity

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.000
and infiltrate Fengliu Shop

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:01.840
to avenge my whole family?

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:04.750
Isn't that

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:06.400
what you wanted, miss?

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.160
Mr. Tang, I've discovered

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:11.960
that West Wind Garden is an abandoned
breeding ground

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.550
for curse bugs used by Yique Yinyang

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:14.480
and is also Fengliu Shop's

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.080
last remaining stronghold.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:20.960
Little Fox,

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:22.310
why have you been

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:23.510
acting so mysteriously

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:25.440
since you returned from the bronze tree?

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.160
That old fellow Puzhu has been waiting
for you

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.030
at Wenxin Lake for days,

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:28.790
but you never showed up.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:29.480
Do you know that?

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.350
Luckily, I'm smart enough.

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:31.280
I found you here.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.920
Though you're competing for
the Sword Master position

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.920
to help out

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.030
that old man Shao Yanping,

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:36.550
since you're participating,

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:38.150
we should take it seriously.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.550
Look at Xifang Tao.

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:40.590
She's been bustling about
enthusiastically

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:41.780
every day at the Sword Alliance,

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.070
instructing disciples in their practice,

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:44.110
sharing secret manuals,

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:45.590
and even donating

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:47.780
the spoils from raiding Fengliu Shop.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.640
That boy Jiang Wenbo

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.440
is absolutely smitten with her.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:53.480
That's nice.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:57.720
Little Fox,

00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.170
let me tell you,

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:00.510
I'm now

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:01.830
an Elder.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:02.880
I have

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:03.750
10 votes.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:05.030
Given our relationship,

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:05.690
1,000 taels

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:06.310
per vote.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.140
How many do you want to buy?

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:11.680
None.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:16.590
Well, if you lose,

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:17.790
don't be too upset.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:18.550
You wouldn't even

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:19.440
spend this little money.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.000
Even with Zhao Quanyang's blessing,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.200
it's no surprise you won't get elected.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:34.830
The election is imminent,

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:36.110
and I still don't know

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:37.840
what Xifang Tao is really up to.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.680
There's still been no news from Chi Yun.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:22:59.720
Mr. Tang,

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.100
I'll enter the West Wind Garden.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:01.480
[West Wind Garden]

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.160
Also,

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:03.880
on my way to the West Wind Garden,

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.880
I ran into Chi Yun.

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:06.680
The remaining members of the Fengliu Shop

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.330
are hiding in the West Wind Garden,

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:09.510
continuing to produce the poison pill,

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:11.240
attempting to make a comeback.

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.960
The surrounding area is
extremely dangerous.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.790
After you receive

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:16.000
this lead about Chi Yun,

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
I hope you'll come and look for him
as soon as possible.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:23.880
Bai Suche,

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:24.750
you've got guts.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:26.110
You dared betray me

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:26.960
right in front of the Leader.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.220
Now I can't explain myself to the Leader.

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:30.870
Why don't you come with me

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.110
to see what's actually hidden

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:33.440
in the Leader's garden?

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.510
Fine!

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:39.530
I'll go with you!

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.920
After knowing me for so long,

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.120
you still don't know I'm invulnerable?

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.830
You're finally here!

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.970
Dare to attack my woman?

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.460
You deserve to die.

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:04.370
The red lotus blooms for sinful karma,

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:05.830
bringing salvation to the living,
the dead,

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:06.790
and lost souls!

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.190
He actually followed me.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:28.810
Are you alright?

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.410
What's going on?

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.170
It's dangerous.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:41.510
Let's get out of here.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.270
We've fallen into a trap.

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.720
Why are there so many poisoned people?

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.160
I'll clear a path for you.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:06.890
You go first!

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.900
Save your strength!

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:10.960
Protect yourself!

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:16.200
Chi Yun!

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:16.950
You...

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.140
Listen,

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.840
Zhong Chunji

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.010
gave me a bolt of heavenly silk.

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:23.440
Have it made into robes
and embroidered with gold thread,

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.240
and they'll become the most beautiful

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.510
wedding garments in the world.

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:26.270
And a pair of matching bracelets

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.070
that allow the wearers
to sense each other.

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.590
If...

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.170
If I can't make it out this time,

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:35.210
these will be your wedding gifts.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.810
What do you mean?

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:39.070
You want me to marry someone else

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.720

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.450
and jade bracelets you gave me?

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:44.830
If you can't

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:46.400
walk out of here alive with me,

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.200
I'll burn that stupid fabric
and those bracelets!

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:20.440
No wonder even the

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.400
Soul-seeking Technique

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.790

couldn't find Chi Yun.

There is indeed something wrong
with the West Wind Garden.

Chi Yun...

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.790

Where are we going?

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:35.950
Why does my head hurt so much?

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:38.050
I got drunk last night?

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:40.630
You don't remember anything?

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:42.310
Should I

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:43.880
remember something?

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:49.480
Why did you come?

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:51.030
Why didn't you leave?

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:54.840
I dragged you into this.

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.040
How long has Chi Yun been poisoned?

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.000
Three days and three nights.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:01.510
This is

where Ghostly Peony refined his poisons,

and it's also the most venomous place

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:11.030
by tearing at the flesh and blood
of the weak.

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:11.760
It's like...

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:13.750
It's like a...

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.750
An arena for the poisoned.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:16.160
Yes.

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.310
Chi Yun has been infected

by their poisonous blood

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.480

If he wakes up,

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.290
he'll lose his mind.

Moreover,

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.030
this trap seems

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:32.160
to have been set specifically for him.

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:00.040
Mr. Tang, your blood can
neutralize the poison?

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.970
It can only suppress
the poison temporarily.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:03.860
However...

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:07.430
I'll think of other methods.

Say something.

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:17.760
What should I remember?

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.400
This Worry-Relieving Pill

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.440
can make him temporarily forget

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.970
his most painful memories.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.330
He'll forget me.

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:26.730
Don't let him see my face either.

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:28.710
It'll trigger his poison attack.

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:30.590
Yesterday, you were

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:32.450
drunk at the foot of the mountain.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:33.480
That's it?

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:34.790
Yes.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:36.320
That's all.

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:47.480
Foxy Tang.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.160
This is the first time I've caught you

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:50.960
lying to me.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.560
You're hiding something from me, right?

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:54.640
Tell me.

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:57.550
Am I dying from some incurable illness,

00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:58.590
or

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:00.820
is it a hidden internal injury?

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:04.490
Chi Yun.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.610
After you got drunk last night,

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:14.690
you were poisoned.

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:16.480
I knew it.

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:18.300
Which bastard did this to me?

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.300
I'll go after him!

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.560
That person is already dead.

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:26.750
You should return to Mount Cloud
for a few days.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:28.960
Remember,

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:30.840
meditate more

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:32.469
and get plenty of rest.

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:34.320
Wait for me to detoxify you.

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:35.280
Got it.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:36.770
With you around,

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:38.889
there's no poison you can't cure.

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:41.440
You're right.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.239
There's no poison I can't cure.

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:47.500
Although...

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:51.449
this time will be a bit more troublesome.

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:58.420
Chi Yun's poison can't be suppressed
much longer.

00:34:58.420 --> 00:34:59.510
I must find a way

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.110
to help Liu Yan accelerate

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:02.970
the development of the antidote.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.530
I observe strict religious precepts.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:17.030
I'm afraid I can't accept

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:18.270
your food and wine.

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:20.550
Perhaps you should offer them to the souls

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:22.680
of the Ranqing Sect who died unjustly.

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.100
Our paths differ.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:27.280
But we can still work together.

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:34.110
Sir, you saw

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:35.940
my golden eyes and forehead mark,

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:37.030
yet you didn't kill me.

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:38.560
Why did you save me instead?

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.240
After that great battle,

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.670
I went up the mountain to find you.

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:42.800
Within 500 zhang

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:45.790
of where Yu Qifeng died, nothing grows.

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:47.380
The poison has penetrated 10 zhang
into the ground,

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.000
and its toxicity is
extraordinarily severe.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:49.600
It was you.

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:50.960
You contained that poisonous mist

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.690
within that 500-zhang radius,

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:54.930
preventing it from
spreading down the mountain

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:56.590
and harming innocent people.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:35:59.930
So you're

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.570
concerned about me?

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.220
But perhaps...

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.400
I need this obsession

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.360
so I won't be

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:10.700
a wandering ghost.

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:30.250
Mr. Tang.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.360
So you've been waiting for Mr. Tang.

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:37.440
Unfortunately, he's been quite busy
these days.

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:38.810
You shouldn't be here.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.230
Now that my master is gone,

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:42.000
there is no "should"

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:42.930
or "shouldn't."

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.480
If I hadn't come here,

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.800
I wouldn't have gotten to see you.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.510
You've had

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:48.350
many things to handle recently.

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:49.860
Sir, you're not being honest.

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:51.120
It's not that I'm busy—

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:54.120
it's that you've been avoiding me.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.740
News came from Tianjing Pavilion

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.020
that the Pavilion Master is gravely ill

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.590
and has summoned me back at once.

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:05.510
Master Shao says

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:07.360
I save others but do not care for them,

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.530
yet he doesn't know that I help others
to help myself.

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:11.000
I cannot let go of worldly attachments,

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:11.550
so my master only accepted me

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:12.710
as a lay disciple.

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:15.170
This time,

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.460
I'll take over Tianjing Pavilion...

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:21.080
and never return to
the secular world again.

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:22.770
You chose Mr. Tang.

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:25.530
I cannot decide
which of the three of you...

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.360
is most fit to be the Sword Master.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:29.850
I abstain

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.010
from voting.

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:33.670
Your leaving...

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:37.720
hurts me much more

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:39.890
than losing your vote.

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:40.620

It's such a relief that Mr. Chi came back safely

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:17.110
despite everything.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.030
But who could have set up

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:21.030
that formation in West Wind Garden?

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:23.360
No matter who it was,

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:25.160
one thing is certain:

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:27.230
like Xifang Tao, they

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:28.250
don't want

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:31.280
the Evil Pill crisis to end quickly.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.360
But there's no need to worry.

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.730
I've asked Master Cheng

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.150
to relocate all the poisoned victims

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:40.480
to Sword King City.

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:42.800
Once the antidote is developed,

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:43.590
their plot

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.880
will collapse on its own.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.420
However, Senior Shui says

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.480
that the Blood Ghost Pill is
extremely complex.

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.360
The antidote's development

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.360
might still be far from completion.

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:55.070
With only one Physician of Miracle,

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:56.670
progress is naturally slow.

00:39:57.110 --> 00:39:57.800
But if...

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:04.570
Master Shao.

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:09.050
This is a list of medicinal herbs.

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:11.030
Master Shao, I'd like to trouble you

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:12.510
to deliver the herbs on the list

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:13.880
to the marked location

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.080
on the back of the map.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.320
There's

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:19.610
also a divine physician there.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:21.280
Rest assured.

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:22.640
I'll take care of it.

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:24.210
Master Shao,

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:26.430
aren't you going to ask me

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:27.760
who these ingredients

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.630
are for?

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:33.000
I've never studied medicine.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.320
Even if you told me,
I wouldn't understand,

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.120
so I won't ask.

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:36.710
But rest assured,

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:39.210
this old man can still handle tasks

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:41.630
like running errands
and delivering messages.

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:43.030
They're for that person.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:46.680
He's...

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:48.890
staying there.

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:55.260
Is that place...

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.630
safe enough?

00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:59.400
If Xifang Tao

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.230
seizes the Sword Master position,

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:02.030
then there will be

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:03.830
no safe place left under heaven.

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:08.480
While you've been busy,

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.340
she hasn't been idle for a moment—

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.140
seeking support everywhere.

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:13.840
I think I just heard

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.260
that she went to see Chunji again.

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:18.630
Anyway,

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.700
I can rest easy knowing

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:22.790
this matter is in your hands.

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:24.280
I'm leaving.

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.510
You always come and go in such a hurry.

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:27.770
At least finish your tea before leaving.

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:29.320
I forgot

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.150
that you don't like Master Cheng's tea.

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:32.810
Let me get you something else.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:33.710
It's fine.

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.480
Many things

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:39.520
you don't like at first,

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.760
but as you keep trying them,

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:42.820
you get used to them

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:45.490
and eventually come to like them.

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:47.110
You

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:49.680
shouldn't force yourself.

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.450
Master Shao, rest assured,

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:52.280
I have

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.060
always been the one...

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:55.810
forcing others.

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.830
That's right.

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:14.490
What are you looking at, Your Highness?

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:15.070
I'm looking at

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:17.000
the scenery my master saw that day.

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:18.590
I want to know

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.890
what Mount Cloud looks like

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:24.630
in my master's eyes.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:38.070
Xifang Tao

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:40.930
requests an audience with the Princess.

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:55.690
What a beautifully vivid butterfly.

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:57.170
It's a pity that...

00:42:58.510 --> 00:42:59.710
it's only an ornament,

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:00.840
made by human hands,

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:03.160
unable to spread its wings and fly.

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:10.160
Do you like it, Miss Xifang?

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:11.670
I do.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.330
It's yours then.

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:19.150
I prefer

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.510
the one on you.

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:23.010
After all,

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:24.710
who doesn't enjoy

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:26.970
having something to manipulate at will?

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:28.690
How dare you!

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:34.630
Your Highness should keep your voice down.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.850
After all, if anyone hears

00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:38.690
this,

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:41.270
you won't survive.

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:46.050
Are you wondering

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:48.840
how I knew about it even though I wasn't

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:51.420
at the Peony Pavilion that day?

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.610
Like Liu Yan, you're

00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:00.860
trying to use it to threaten me?

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:02.710
Threaten?

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.670
No.

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:09.170
I'm offering you a deal.

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:11.520
You can continue being a princess,

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.190
and I'll become the Sword Master.

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:15.720
If we two women join forces,

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:17.840
both the imperial court

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:18.760
and the jianghu

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.510
will be under our control.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:23.760
Wouldn't that be

00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:25.510
a wonderful world?
