00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.840
Winter, 24th year of Guangxu

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:01.680
Seventeen at Jingyang Girls' School
hanged themselves to show resolve

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:03.119
This is not suppression

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.680
It is martyrdom

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:39.760
This time

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.080
We made Liu Chunru come to us herself

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.959
If I follow your logic

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:47.160
there's another group faking ghosts

00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:49.720
just to bury Liu Chunru's body

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.879
Exactly

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.599
So who are they?

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:57.879
Come out

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:07.919
It's you

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.320
Last night, you were on the city tower

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.919
and took Liu Chunru's head

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.679
You two

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.600
So the smoke was your doing

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.000
You said someone asked you

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.320
to bury Liu Chunru's body

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.880
Who entrusted you?

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.199
Liu Chunru herself

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.199
Her last wish before death

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:27.800
was to be properly buried

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.759
And what about you two?

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.000
Oh, that

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.199
That's Lin Ruizhi

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:35.440
the magistrate's concubine

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.960
The one beside her?

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:38.240
Should be her accomplice

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.960
The ghost of Liu Chunru

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:41.399
was likely her disguise

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.679
These two women are truly bold

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:47.440
First at the mortuary

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.000
they stole Liu Chunru's body

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.800
Liu Chunru

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.639
Then at the magistrate's and the school

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:52.679
they pretended to be ghosts

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:53.440
Master

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.880
No one outside

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:58.960
When did you find out?

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.279
First

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.600
And you?

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.600
You worked at Jingyang Girls' School

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.160
likely crossed paths with Liu Chunru

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:07.479
Second

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.679
You told us a story

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
about a vengeful ghost seeking her head

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:13.800
But in your room

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.520
there were no signs of struggle

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.119
and the magistrate was only drugged

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.440
That alone is suspicious

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.679
Until later

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:22.600
we discovered

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.600
you and the mortuary elder

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.520
share the same eye disease

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:29.399
What's on your left cuff?

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.800
Ink stains

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.919
You just said

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.839
what kind of lock?

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.800
Black lock

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.080
Once questioned

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:37.399
we found you're father and daughter

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.039
Then everything made sense

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.759
My father knew nothing

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:42.440
I secretly made a key

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.360
and snuck in

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.000
We staged a scene to fool him

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.360
and stole the body

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:47.279
Don't blame him

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.559
So you went through all this

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.800
just to bury Liu Chunru

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.440
Now the authorities search the city

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.839
for anyone linked to rebels

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:00.479
Even Liu Chunru's family

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:01.520
avoid her at all costs

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.080
afraid to be associated

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.399
But you two

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:05.880
dare to claim her body

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.240
Aren't you afraid of losing your heads?

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.880
As sworn sisters

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:09.880
how could we

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.440
stand by and watch her body

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.479
left exposed in the wild

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.119
Such a vast world

00:04:17.119 --> 00:04:19.359
can't even hold a woman's desk

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.959
The principal and teachers

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.799
resisted the closure in this way

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.440
Such good people

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:32.880
shouldn't end like this

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.519
They use blood and fire

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.600
to warn us

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:39.239
This world

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.320
shouldn't be like this

00:04:42.079 --> 00:04:42.880
Lianfang

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.279
Ruizhi

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:46.160
I came this time

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.640
to say goodbye to you both

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.040
I'm preparing to leave here

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:53.839
to seek a true path to save our country

00:04:55.799 --> 00:04:56.640
Lianfang

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:58.160
Ruizhi

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.679
Hope this letter finds you well

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.959
I've enrolled in school

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:03.920
and joined several hometown associations

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.920
There are many new ideas here

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.000
I've met many insightful people

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.320
Life is fulfilling

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:13.480
I work hard every day

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.679
never daring to slack off

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.799
Chunru

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:17.640
Reading your words feels like seeing you

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:20.200
The court and country are in turmoil

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.480
Life is even harder for common folk

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.600
It's been months since we parted

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.480
Now I hear you're well

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:27.880
and I am relieved

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.000
But I fear I won't be able

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.359
to write to you freely anymore

00:05:31.359 --> 00:05:33.239
Ruizhi became the magistrate's concubine

00:05:33.239 --> 00:05:34.000
Because my family

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.559
promised me as a concubine

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.040
I resisted

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.799
but they didn't care

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.000
Feudalism

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.720
is rotten and backward

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:44.519
I've decided

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.079
to join the revolution

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.760
The road ahead is hard

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.679
but it's the path of hope

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.160
I'll return home in February

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.239
then

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.760
I'll meet you both as soon as I arrive

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:00.040
Wishing you peace

00:06:01.359 --> 00:06:02.720
Rebel Liu Chunru

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:05.119
You seek to overthrow the Qing dynasty

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:05.720
Kneel

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.920
Your crime is unforgivable

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:08.959
By order of the Empress Dowager

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:10.559
You are sentenced to beheading and public display

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.799
Execution date to be set

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.239
No one

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:14.600
may claim your body

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:16.399
Throw my head

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:18.399
to shake the land

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:19.559
No regrets

00:06:19.799 --> 00:06:20.880
Take her away

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:28.600
There's something I need to ask.

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:31.600
I want to ask my dearest friends.

00:06:32.799 --> 00:06:33.519
Right now,

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:36.079
I've cut ties with my whole family.

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:38.480
If I die,

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:41.079
my body may be left in the wild.

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:42.040
So,

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:44.679
you must stay alive, no matter what.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.279
When the time comes,

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:48.559
please bury me.

00:06:50.239 --> 00:06:50.959
Chunru,

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.040
I won't let you say such unlucky things.

00:06:53.359 --> 00:06:54.640
Alright, alright, I won't say it.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.640
It's a promise.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.239
If anything happens to you, Liu Chunru,

00:06:59.359 --> 00:07:01.279
even if it's through hell and high water,

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:05.760
we'll come to bury you.

00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:12.720
Beheading and public display.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.600
No one is allowed to bury the body.

00:07:15.359 --> 00:07:16.839
It's a punishment meant to warn and deter.

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:18.040
That's why it's so cruel.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.079
Actually, this punishment

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.000
was abolished years ago.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.839
I guess

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:26.519
when Liu Chunru made that promise with you two,

00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:27.760
she was thinking about this.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.880
She just didn't expect

00:07:30.119 --> 00:07:31.079
the Empress Dowager, because of the revolutionaries,

00:07:31.079 --> 00:07:32.720
would be so furious about what they did.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.640
She personally issued the decree

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.679
for her beheading.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.600
She probably didn't want

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.440
you two to get dragged into danger.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.279
She sacrificed herself for her ideals.

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:44.119
How can we just watch her body

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.839
be humiliated like this?

00:07:46.679 --> 00:07:48.040
But with just the two of you,

00:07:48.559 --> 00:07:50.160
going against the Forbidden City for her head,

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.200
it's just not realistic.

00:07:54.359 --> 00:07:55.679
Mountains may fall and seas may dry,

00:07:56.679 --> 00:07:58.079
but a promise remains.

00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:10.079
Wait, that's not right.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.200
I've already buried Liu Chunru's body.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.559
Why didn't any spirit aura appear?

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.399
Even though

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.079
you said Chunru asked you

00:08:27.079 --> 00:08:28.279
to bury her,

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.239
we still want to thank you.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.159
As for payment,

00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:35.640
letting her rest in peace,

00:08:36.239 --> 00:08:37.919
fulfilling her last wish,

00:08:38.359 --> 00:08:39.679
is all the reward I need.

00:08:49.239 --> 00:08:50.919
Actually, Liu Chunru's final wish

00:08:51.119 --> 00:08:52.679
wasn't just to be buried by someone.

00:08:54.359 --> 00:08:55.679
Liu Chunru thought

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.880
if someone buried her,

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.280
you two wouldn't have to risk your lives.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.039
So,

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:05.440
this revolutionary who died with lofty ideals,

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.119
her final wish

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.679
was just for you two to be safe.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.359
Hurry!

00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:15.320
Offer incense to her yourselves.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:35.840
Spirit aura.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.919
It's Liu Chunru's spirit aura.

00:09:38.239 --> 00:09:39.479
Her wish is truly fulfilled.

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:41.039
He Fuyi, let me out now!

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.080
Go on.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.320
You're no use to me now.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.239
Don't follow us.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.520
He Escort Chief,

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.280
look,

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.960
I helped you find Liu Chunru.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.280
Just treat me as a delivery.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.599
Send me back to the capital.

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:08.719
I'm not taking this job.

00:10:09.119 --> 00:10:10.080
Come on!

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.599
Look,

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.719
burying Liu Chunru

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.080
the authorities won't just let it go.

00:10:16.599 --> 00:10:17.760
But actually,

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.080
the Old Buddha really likes me.

00:10:20.719 --> 00:10:22.320
Once I finish this job,

00:10:22.559 --> 00:10:23.559
I'll put in a good word for you.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:24.599
I guarantee

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.159
you'll get through this.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.000
How about it?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.679
He Escort Chief,

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.799
I like him.

00:10:32.919 --> 00:10:34.080
He can enter dreams.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.359
His scent is so familiar.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.559
And he's so smart.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.840
Let's take his job.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.359
We can earn money,

00:10:42.599 --> 00:10:43.479
and along the way,

00:10:43.479 --> 00:10:44.880
he can help us collect

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.520
lots of spirit aura.

00:10:51.239 --> 00:10:52.599
It's been so long since we gathered

00:10:52.599 --> 00:10:54.239
this much spirit aura.

00:10:54.359 --> 00:10:56.640
I feel so strong now.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.280
How about you?

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.880
I feel much better too.

00:11:02.359 --> 00:11:03.799
Why aren't you convinced?

00:11:04.239 --> 00:11:05.080
Not convinced.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.039
He found Liu Chunru's true wish before you.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.919
Different paths, same destination.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.799
It all means the same thing.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.679
You think I meddled too much.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.840
How did you figure out

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.640
Liu Chunru's true wish?

00:11:24.239 --> 00:11:25.679
I want to know

00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:27.799
how you were so sure from the start

00:11:27.919 --> 00:11:30.159
her wish was to be buried by someone.

00:11:30.239 --> 00:11:31.799
Liu Chunru said it herself.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.000
She hoped someone would bury her.

00:11:34.039 --> 00:11:35.679
After hearing Lin Ruizhi

00:11:35.679 --> 00:11:37.280
and Xu Lianfang's story,

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:37.960
it's the same.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.559
She asked them to bury her too.

00:11:42.119 --> 00:11:43.159
Let me ask you again,

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.919
Xu Lianfang and Lin Ruizhi,

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.280
two women with so many burdens,

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.239
why would they risk their lives

00:11:49.239 --> 00:11:50.320
just to bury Liu Chunru?

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.520
Because

00:11:52.039 --> 00:11:53.799
they promised Liu Chunru.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.440
He Escort Chief,

00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:01.960
you really

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.359
are something.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.200
So,

00:12:13.919 --> 00:12:15.320
what do you think my action just now

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.200
meant?

00:12:16.599 --> 00:12:17.719
You wanted to provoke me.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.440
I finally get it.

00:12:25.799 --> 00:12:26.400
He Escort Chief,

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.400
you seem naturally indifferent.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.119
You can't feel emotions like normal people.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.440
That's right.

00:12:33.679 --> 00:12:36.000
He Fuyi is like a big rock,

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.400
so stiff,

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.080
so cold,

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.159
and kind of clueless.

00:13:10.719 --> 00:13:11.479
Come out.

00:13:14.239 --> 00:13:15.359
Greetings, Prince.

00:13:15.719 --> 00:13:16.359
Prince.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.280
You were startled.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.280
Go back and tell Yiru.

00:13:18.679 --> 00:13:20.039
I'm running errands for the Old Buddha.

00:13:20.479 --> 00:13:21.280
You follow me.

00:13:21.719 --> 00:13:22.840
But don't act rashly.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.280
Yes.

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:50.760
Want something to eat?
