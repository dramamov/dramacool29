00:00:10.791 --> 00:00:17.791
950 YEARS HAVE PASSED
SINCE THE APPEARANCE OF THE FIRST SAMURAI

00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:25.541
WITH ONE BATTLE,
THEY VANISHED FROM HISTORY

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.166
Charge!

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.500
Charge!

00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:01.875
It's over!

00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.791
Raise the cry of victory!

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.583
Send up the smoke signal!

00:02:21.583 --> 00:02:22.541
What was that?

00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:24.000
What's happening?

00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:27.041
Enough! It's over!

00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:29.583
It's already over! Cease fire!

00:02:52.208 --> 00:02:53.291
Stop…

00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:54.666
Enough!

00:02:56.833 --> 00:03:00.416
Stop!

00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:39.833
Shino.

00:04:40.875 --> 00:04:43.541
-Let me take over.
-I didn't mean to wake you.

00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.041
Toya, get me a hand towel.

00:04:49.125 --> 00:04:50.041
Okay.

00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:55.208
Here.

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:01.750
Father…

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.708
It hurts.

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:08.916
Rin.

00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:12.500
It's going to be okay.
You'll feel better soon.

00:05:14.541 --> 00:05:20.500
I'm sorry. I tried not to catch it.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.875
Don't blame yourself.

00:05:26.666 --> 00:05:27.666
Thank you.

00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:42.166
FUCHU, KANAGAWA

00:06:28.833 --> 00:06:30.666
Enough! It's over!

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.541
It's already over! Cease fire!

00:06:55.666 --> 00:06:59.041
Ten years since the Boshin War.

00:06:59.125 --> 00:07:04.125
Under the new government's modernization
policies, samurai became "Shizoku,"

00:07:04.208 --> 00:07:07.833
stripping them
of their privileges and employment.

00:07:07.916 --> 00:07:14.916
Meanwhile, lives were devastated
by a widespread outbreak of Cholera.

00:07:25.833 --> 00:07:28.625
Mama!

00:07:34.708 --> 00:07:35.958
Mr. Saga.

00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:39.916
You keep bringing me worthless things.
What am I supposed to do with them?

00:07:40.541 --> 00:07:43.500
Forgive me, but please--

00:07:43.583 --> 00:07:45.083
Don't do this to me.

00:07:45.666 --> 00:07:48.166
It's already been two years
since the Sword Abolishment Edict.

00:07:48.833 --> 00:07:51.958
You know the days
of the sword are long gone.

00:07:55.291 --> 00:07:58.333
Mr. Saga, don't make this more difficult.

00:07:58.416 --> 00:07:59.666
I'll take any price.

00:08:00.875 --> 00:08:04.333
Once the cholera passes,
I'll repay your kindness. I swear it.

00:08:04.416 --> 00:08:08.000
So please, I'm begging you.

00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:15.625
Shino and Rin…

00:08:17.041 --> 00:08:18.166
Is it really that bad?

00:08:27.458 --> 00:08:30.458
Go and fetch some sugar and salt for him.

00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:31.791
Of course.

00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:37.791
I don't need your sword.

00:08:38.666 --> 00:08:39.833
Take it back with you.

00:08:42.333 --> 00:08:43.500
Thank you.

00:08:46.041 --> 00:08:47.666
What a time we're living in.

00:08:50.166 --> 00:08:52.625
How did things end up like this?

00:08:57.916 --> 00:08:59.291
It wasn't there yesterday.

00:08:59.375 --> 00:09:03.500
PAWN SHOP

00:09:03.583 --> 00:09:04.791
It says it's in Kyoto.

00:09:05.291 --> 00:09:07.375
"The opportunity to win 100,000 yen."

00:09:07.458 --> 00:09:10.541
-A hundred thousand yen?
-What nonsense.

00:09:10.625 --> 00:09:12.125
Can it be real?

00:09:12.208 --> 00:09:14.666
No way a martial arts tournament
would pay 100,000 yen.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.166
Still, 100,000 yen? That's…

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.916
Enough for ten generations
to live in luxury.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.250
A martial arts tournament, huh?

00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:26.500
-Hey, gimme one.
-Me too.

00:09:26.583 --> 00:09:29.208
PARTICIPANTS WANTED
ASSEMBLE AT TENRYUJI TEMPLE IN KYOTO

00:09:29.291 --> 00:09:31.458
"Those who excel in the martial arts."

00:09:31.541 --> 00:09:32.708
"Tenryuji Temple."

00:09:33.333 --> 00:09:37.166
"A hundred thousand yen."

00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.500
This is no ordinary
martial arts tournament.

00:09:41.583 --> 00:09:43.416
I wonder.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.833
Hey!

00:09:44.916 --> 00:09:45.916
What's going on?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.625
What's the problem?

00:09:47.708 --> 00:09:49.875
-Nothing to see here.
-Hey, what is this?

00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.625
Can we really win 100,000 yen?

00:09:51.708 --> 00:09:52.625
How does it work?

00:09:52.708 --> 00:09:54.125
-No concern of yours.
-Hand it over.

00:09:54.208 --> 00:09:56.000
You're just as guilty for taking it!

00:10:03.375 --> 00:10:04.208
Rin!

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.250
Rin!

00:10:08.458 --> 00:10:10.833
Rin!

00:10:10.916 --> 00:10:13.375
-Rin!
-Rin!

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.458
Rin!

00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958
Rin!

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.208
Father…

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.791
I couldn't protect Mother and Toya.

00:10:37.458 --> 00:10:39.125
I'm sorry.

00:10:42.791 --> 00:10:44.083
Rin!

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.041
Rin!

00:10:47.291 --> 00:10:48.333
Rin…

00:10:50.125 --> 00:10:51.125
Rin…

00:11:09.791 --> 00:11:11.333
Forgive me.

00:12:35.375 --> 00:12:41.750
ASSEMBLE AT TENRYUJI TEMPLE IN KYOTO
AT MIDNIGHT ON MAY 5TH

00:13:21.916 --> 00:13:23.458
Shujiro?

00:13:26.416 --> 00:13:27.458
Shino.

00:13:28.916 --> 00:13:32.541
I'm sorry, but I'll be gone for a while.

00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:35.375
I've found a job
that could bring in some money.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:47.708
With this money, I can save you
and everyone in the village.

00:13:52.666 --> 00:13:56.083
Will you draw your sword again?

00:13:58.541 --> 00:13:59.833
I wouldn't do that.

00:14:01.125 --> 00:14:02.500
Don't worry.

00:14:15.625 --> 00:14:17.083
Please stay safe.

00:14:28.208 --> 00:14:29.666
I promise I'll return.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:33.583
I know.

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:22.000
KYOTO

00:15:23.166 --> 00:15:24.791
Yes, come in!

00:15:24.875 --> 00:15:27.791
Flowers for sale!

00:15:27.875 --> 00:15:32.208
Flowers for sale!

00:15:33.208 --> 00:15:36.666
-Flowers for sale!
-Get them while they last!

00:15:43.708 --> 00:15:45.541
That thing in the newspaper is tonight?

00:15:45.625 --> 00:15:49.041
Yeah. I heard it's part
of a government sword hunt.

00:15:49.125 --> 00:15:51.083
What is it? Can we go see?

00:15:51.166 --> 00:15:53.791
It's not safe. Don't you go near
Tenryuji Temple today.

00:15:53.875 --> 00:15:55.125
Why not?

00:16:06.708 --> 00:16:08.041
Welcome.

00:16:08.125 --> 00:16:08.958
Come in.

00:16:13.916 --> 00:16:14.916
Sir Saga?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.250
Yahei, it's been a long time.

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.291
A long time, indeed.

00:16:22.625 --> 00:16:23.750
I don't suppose…

00:16:24.333 --> 00:16:26.083
You too?

00:16:26.166 --> 00:16:27.708
Are there others like me?

00:16:27.791 --> 00:16:28.750
Yes.

00:16:29.458 --> 00:16:34.750
We've had a few guests of a similar sort.

00:16:37.708 --> 00:16:39.541
Do you know anything?

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:43.500
Survivors of the old shogunate forces

00:16:43.583 --> 00:16:47.125
are gathering comrades, seeking revenge.

00:16:47.208 --> 00:16:50.875
But they're just rumors.
I can't be certain.

00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:53.958
I see.

00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:26.041
Mr. Saga… May I?

00:17:27.541 --> 00:17:28.458
Come in.

00:17:35.833 --> 00:17:37.750
You're going, then?

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.333
Yes.

00:17:40.583 --> 00:17:44.750
Kyoto somehow feels different tonight.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:48.333
Just like in those days,

00:17:50.125 --> 00:17:52.916
there's a stench of blood in the air.

00:17:55.375 --> 00:17:57.041
Please be careful.

00:18:10.791 --> 00:18:15.125
TENRYUJI TEMPLE

00:18:17.875 --> 00:18:19.041
Someone's here.

00:18:34.708 --> 00:18:36.583
Are you here to participate?

00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:39.958
Open the gate.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:52.250
You may enter.

00:20:23.166 --> 00:20:26.125
Man, this is a mess.

00:20:33.125 --> 00:20:35.500
They're blinded by fortune.

00:20:35.583 --> 00:20:38.625
They might start fighting
before this thing even starts.

00:20:41.166 --> 00:20:42.791
Oh, forgive me.

00:20:43.291 --> 00:20:46.083
I talk too much when I get nervous.

00:20:48.125 --> 00:20:52.583
I'm a former samurai of the Kaga domain.
Kouemon Tachikawa.

00:20:52.666 --> 00:20:54.458
The Kaga domain?

00:20:55.041 --> 00:20:57.375
The newspaper made it
all the way to Kanazawa?

00:20:57.458 --> 00:21:01.541
I asked around about that today.

00:21:02.041 --> 00:21:06.083
Seems it was distributed countrywide,
from Hokkaido to Ryukyu.

00:21:06.166 --> 00:21:09.875
To go to so much effort…

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:15.250
Perhaps there's some truth
to the 100,000 yen after all.

00:22:09.625 --> 00:22:11.250
It is time.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:14.625
We shall now begin.

00:22:16.125 --> 00:22:20.416
First of all, thank you all
for assembling here today.

00:22:21.041 --> 00:22:24.625
My name is Enju.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.250
You are about to compete--

00:22:31.333 --> 00:22:33.833
or rather, play a game,

00:22:34.416 --> 00:22:36.666
that will challenge
your mind, skill, and body.

00:22:40.541 --> 00:22:41.666
Of course,

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:44.458
you may doubt the promise
of great wealth from a game.

00:22:44.541 --> 00:22:49.583
You may question if such a sum
as large as 100,000 yen truly exists.

00:23:05.541 --> 00:23:06.666
What's that jar?

00:23:18.625 --> 00:23:22.250
With this much gold,
you could live in luxury for a decade.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:25.708
But the amount you will win

00:23:27.416 --> 00:23:28.666
far surpasses this.

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:40.833
The question is,
how do you obtain such a sum?

00:23:40.916 --> 00:23:42.125
But wait.

00:23:42.708 --> 00:23:43.791
The thing is,

00:23:44.666 --> 00:23:46.625
once you hear the means,

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.958
you cannot withdraw from the game
under any circumstances.

00:23:52.333 --> 00:23:53.208
What do you mean?

00:23:55.958 --> 00:23:58.458
Now, I'm going to count down from 30.

00:23:58.958 --> 00:24:01.750
If you no longer wish to participate,

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:04.791
please leave before I finish counting.

00:24:06.458 --> 00:24:07.833
Thirty.

00:24:07.916 --> 00:24:08.750
Twenty-nine.

00:24:09.958 --> 00:24:10.791
Twenty-eight.

00:24:11.875 --> 00:24:12.875
Twenty-seven.

00:24:12.958 --> 00:24:14.583
-I'm not quitting now!
-Twenty-six.

00:24:14.666 --> 00:24:16.250
Twenty-five.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:18.250
That's enough.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.875
Stay where you are.

00:24:34.958 --> 00:24:37.458
I'm Ando from the
Kyoto Prefectural Police, Division Four.

00:24:38.708 --> 00:24:40.083
An-Jin the Rushing Gust.

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:45.750
The Fourth Division?

00:24:46.291 --> 00:24:50.541
But since you're standing here,
you are a participant as well.

00:24:51.041 --> 00:24:53.000
Seems you don't know who I am.

00:24:53.083 --> 00:24:55.541
Of course I know you,
An-Jin the Rushing Gust.

00:24:56.041 --> 00:24:57.666
Had you been born earlier,

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:00.541
the manslayers and Shinsengumi
wouldn't have stood a chance.

00:25:00.625 --> 00:25:03.333
Or so you boldly claim.

00:25:03.416 --> 00:25:05.000
It's the truth.

00:25:05.666 --> 00:25:08.416
I'm arresting you for violating
the Sword Abolishment Edict.

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:12.166
Don't be so serious. It's just a game.

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.166
Who's the organizer? Where are they?

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:16.208
No idea.

00:25:17.125 --> 00:25:20.333
Put your hands out. Or I'll cut you down.

00:25:22.041 --> 00:25:25.916
So, you won't be participating?

00:25:26.708 --> 00:25:30.208
Well, that's too bad.

00:25:31.625 --> 00:25:32.791
Cut the crap.

00:25:55.583 --> 00:25:58.916
My apologies for the interruption.

00:26:01.375 --> 00:26:05.166
I shall resume counting.

00:26:10.458 --> 00:26:11.416
Twenty-four.

00:26:12.666 --> 00:26:14.000
Twenty-three.

00:26:14.708 --> 00:26:15.750
Twenty-two.

00:26:15.833 --> 00:26:17.666
-I'm not turning back now.
-Twenty-one.

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:19.291
-This is bad.
-Twenty.

00:26:20.333 --> 00:26:21.583
Nineteen.

00:26:21.666 --> 00:26:23.500
-Are you going to stay?
-Eighteen.

00:26:23.583 --> 00:26:25.125
-I can't do this!
-Seventeen.

00:26:25.208 --> 00:26:27.125
-Don't give up now!
-Sixteen.

00:26:27.208 --> 00:26:28.958
-I'm going to play!
-Fifteen.

00:26:29.041 --> 00:26:30.041
Me too!

00:26:30.125 --> 00:26:32.458
-Fourteen.
-If I give up now and go home…

00:26:32.541 --> 00:26:34.166
-Thirteen.
-It's for the money!

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:35.166
Twelve.

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:37.375
Eleven.

00:26:38.083 --> 00:26:38.958
Ten.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:41.291
Nine.

00:26:41.375 --> 00:26:42.291
Eight.

00:26:43.291 --> 00:26:44.291
Seven.

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:46.583
Six.

00:26:46.666 --> 00:26:47.666
Five.

00:26:48.583 --> 00:26:49.416
Four.

00:26:51.625 --> 00:26:53.541
Three, two, one.

00:26:55.375 --> 00:26:56.625
Excellent.

00:26:58.083 --> 00:27:01.625
Your courage is truly admirable.

00:27:26.875 --> 00:27:30.250
MAP OF TOKAIDO ROAD
TENRYUJI TEMPLE

00:27:30.833 --> 00:27:34.500
The game you are
about to participate in is called

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:36.250
"Kodoku."

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:40.500
And every game comes with rules.

00:27:41.375 --> 00:27:42.750
Write your name on this.

00:27:42.833 --> 00:27:44.291
Your name, please.

00:27:44.375 --> 00:27:47.083
I shall now explain the rules in detail.

00:27:47.666 --> 00:27:48.750
Wear this around your neck.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:52.666
Rule one.

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:56.333
Your destination is Tokyo.

00:27:57.291 --> 00:27:58.291
Rule two.

00:27:59.083 --> 00:28:01.000
This is Tenryuji Temple's main gate.

00:28:01.791 --> 00:28:03.000
Seki, Ise Province.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.375
Chiryu, Mikawa Province.

00:28:05.875 --> 00:28:07.583
Hamamatsu, Totoumi Province.

00:28:08.083 --> 00:28:09.750
Shimada, Suruga Province.

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:11.875
Hakone, Sagami Province.

00:28:12.375 --> 00:28:13.958
Shinagawa, Musashi Province.

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:17.791
You must pass through
all seven checkpoints.

00:28:18.583 --> 00:28:19.958
Write your name.

00:28:20.041 --> 00:28:21.416
Wear the wooden tag.

00:28:23.083 --> 00:28:24.291
Rule three.

00:28:24.791 --> 00:28:27.083
If you do not have enough points,

00:28:27.583 --> 00:28:29.666
you cannot proceed to the next town.

00:28:30.166 --> 00:28:31.791
Wear this around your neck.

00:28:31.875 --> 00:28:32.958
Rule four.

00:28:34.125 --> 00:28:37.083
You must not speak
of this game to anyone.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.166
Rule five.

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:43.083
You must arrive in Tokyo

00:28:43.166 --> 00:28:45.458
no later than June 5th,
one month from today.

00:28:46.208 --> 00:28:47.208
Rule six.

00:28:47.833 --> 00:28:50.291
Withdrawing from the game is forbidden.

00:28:50.375 --> 00:28:56.083
If your wooden tag is removed
from your neck for ten counts,

00:28:56.875 --> 00:28:59.250
it will be considered a withdrawal.

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:03.958
Rule seven.

00:29:04.541 --> 00:29:06.291
Anyone who breaks the rules--

00:29:08.833 --> 00:29:09.750
Get me outta here!

00:29:13.541 --> 00:29:14.958
Ten.

00:29:15.041 --> 00:29:16.625
Nine.

00:29:16.708 --> 00:29:17.541
Eight.

00:29:17.625 --> 00:29:18.875
Seven.

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:21.000
Six.

00:29:21.083 --> 00:29:21.958
Five.

00:29:22.833 --> 00:29:24.291
-Four.
-Open the gate!

00:29:24.375 --> 00:29:25.708
Three.

00:29:25.791 --> 00:29:26.791
Two.

00:29:27.625 --> 00:29:28.666
One.

00:29:48.541 --> 00:29:49.791
Rule seven.

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:56.666
Anyone who breaks the rules
will be punished accordingly.

00:30:02.541 --> 00:30:03.791
This is madness.

00:30:08.166 --> 00:30:10.708
Nobody said anything about getting killed!

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:26.208
Silence!

00:30:29.708 --> 00:30:33.208
Did I not confirm
your intent to participate?

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:40.041
You all chose to join this game
of your own free will.

00:30:42.083 --> 00:30:43.750
For 100,000 yen.

00:30:52.833 --> 00:30:57.416
Once again, 292 people
have gathered here today.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:00.791
Each of you has been given a wooden tag
that is worth one point.

00:31:00.875 --> 00:31:03.083
Which means each of you
already has one point.

00:31:05.125 --> 00:31:09.708
To pass through Tenryuji Temple,
you need at least two points.

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:17.291
And you'll need thirty points
at the final checkpoint, Tokyo.

00:31:18.875 --> 00:31:20.833
So, how do you earn points?

00:31:28.208 --> 00:31:30.375
Seems some of you already understand.

00:31:31.875 --> 00:31:34.166
This can't be real. Is he serious?

00:31:39.833 --> 00:31:41.583
You may use any means necessary.

00:31:42.458 --> 00:31:44.416
A fight for the wooden tags.

00:31:59.083 --> 00:32:04.916
I see many among you who survived
the age of turmoil as samurai.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.541
You are precisely the ones who deserve
the right to claim this fortune.

00:32:10.958 --> 00:32:17.333
I ask that you demonstrate
the pride and strength of the samurai.

00:32:21.958 --> 00:32:24.416
Should we team up?

00:32:24.958 --> 00:32:27.458
Some of these guys
are here with their buddies.

00:32:27.541 --> 00:32:29.333
Better than going solo, right?

00:32:29.416 --> 00:32:32.583
Besides, I'm pretty good with a sword.

00:32:33.333 --> 00:32:35.833
After ten counts,

00:32:36.833 --> 00:32:38.250
the game will begin.

00:32:46.416 --> 00:32:48.791
Why is there a child here?

00:32:49.458 --> 00:32:50.375
Ten.

00:32:52.375 --> 00:32:53.333
Nine.

00:32:55.416 --> 00:32:56.458
Eight.

00:32:57.625 --> 00:32:58.583
Seven.

00:32:59.958 --> 00:33:00.875
Six.

00:33:01.916 --> 00:33:03.208
Five.

00:33:04.208 --> 00:33:05.416
Four.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.666
Three.

00:33:08.041 --> 00:33:09.083
Two.

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:11.416
One.

00:33:17.333 --> 00:33:19.750
I shall be waiting for you in Tokyo.

00:33:20.791 --> 00:33:21.958
Or rather…

00:33:27.125 --> 00:33:32.291
In Edo, the city that vanished long ago.

00:33:43.166 --> 00:33:44.791
Let the game begin!

00:33:54.791 --> 00:33:55.791
Come on!

00:34:00.708 --> 00:34:02.208
That's one point for me.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.541
Die!

00:36:25.291 --> 00:36:26.458
Hey!

00:36:36.833 --> 00:36:37.833
Die!

00:36:49.041 --> 00:36:49.916
Sakura.

00:36:52.083 --> 00:36:55.458
Does it bring back memories?
Of the old days?

00:36:57.666 --> 00:36:58.500
No.

00:37:10.833 --> 00:37:12.208
Congratulations.

00:37:12.875 --> 00:37:14.291
Show me your wooden tags.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.583
Ukyo Kikuomi.

00:37:21.375 --> 00:37:22.833
You're the first.

00:37:23.583 --> 00:37:26.000
No wonder they call you
the "Guardian God of the Court Nobles."

00:37:26.625 --> 00:37:28.083
What's the point of all this--

00:37:28.166 --> 00:37:31.000
I'll be waiting for you in Tokyo.

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:38.125
Confirmed.

00:37:38.708 --> 00:37:39.583
Well then…

00:37:40.583 --> 00:37:41.875
Safe journey.

00:37:58.166 --> 00:37:59.333
Father!

00:38:09.416 --> 00:38:12.541
I, um… Thank you, sir.

00:38:12.625 --> 00:38:14.083
Do you intend to survive?

00:38:16.708 --> 00:38:17.791
I want to live.

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.583
I want to live so I can save my mother.

00:38:22.666 --> 00:38:24.791
I'll keep you safe
until we get out of here.

00:38:24.875 --> 00:38:26.208
Don't leave my side.

00:38:26.708 --> 00:38:27.541
I won't.

00:38:27.625 --> 00:38:30.333
Hey, he's got a kid! Stop there!

00:38:30.416 --> 00:38:31.333
Let's go.

00:38:47.416 --> 00:38:48.500
I got one!

00:39:12.666 --> 00:39:13.791
Over there!

00:39:25.666 --> 00:39:26.958
It's mine!

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:28.875
Give it back!

00:39:28.958 --> 00:39:30.416
-Yes!
-Give it to me!

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:31.541
-Ten.
-Give it back!

00:39:32.541 --> 00:39:33.625
Nine.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.041
Eight.

00:39:36.833 --> 00:39:38.166
Seven.

00:39:38.958 --> 00:39:40.208
Six.

00:39:40.291 --> 00:39:41.583
Give it!

00:39:41.666 --> 00:39:42.583
Five.

00:39:43.875 --> 00:39:45.083
Four.

00:39:46.041 --> 00:39:47.208
Three.

00:39:47.916 --> 00:39:49.208
Two.

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:50.833
One.

00:39:52.333 --> 00:39:53.750
120

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:11.333
Grab on.

00:40:11.416 --> 00:40:12.416
That's my tag!

00:40:18.041 --> 00:40:19.208
Hang on!

00:40:21.583 --> 00:40:22.500
Give it!

00:41:07.166 --> 00:41:08.083
Let's move.

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:25.875
So it's not you either.

00:42:14.833 --> 00:42:16.083
Excuse me.

00:42:18.916 --> 00:42:20.958
We have our first to make it through.

00:42:23.875 --> 00:42:27.250
Number 19, Ukyo Kikuomi.

00:42:29.291 --> 00:42:33.083
He's truly living up to the name,
"Guardian God of the Court Nobles."

00:42:33.166 --> 00:42:34.750
"Former" Guardian, I believe.

00:42:34.833 --> 00:42:36.250
Seems he's been through a lot.

00:42:36.333 --> 00:42:40.083
Still, his swordsmanship is impressive.

00:42:40.166 --> 00:42:43.291
Definitely a performance worth watching.

00:42:43.375 --> 00:42:45.583
Well, this is just the beginning.

00:42:46.208 --> 00:42:48.416
The real entertainment is yet to come.

00:42:58.208 --> 00:42:59.250
This way.

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:12.791
What is your name?

00:43:14.333 --> 00:43:16.708
Futaba Katsuki. And you, sir?

00:43:17.208 --> 00:43:18.541
Shujiro Saga.

00:43:22.125 --> 00:43:23.375
What?

00:43:23.458 --> 00:43:25.375
Now you just need to make it to the gate.

00:43:25.458 --> 00:43:27.000
Wait, what about your wooden tag?

00:44:21.333 --> 00:44:23.750
Now, now, calm down.

00:44:23.833 --> 00:44:25.833
I've got no intention of fighting you.

00:44:26.416 --> 00:44:27.958
I'm just going to pick it up.

00:44:28.041 --> 00:44:31.041
Don't come slashing at me out of nowhere.

00:44:41.916 --> 00:44:44.208
Here. Take it.

00:44:47.541 --> 00:44:49.208
What do you want?

00:44:50.375 --> 00:44:52.583
Why are you holding back?

00:44:53.083 --> 00:44:55.333
"Kokushu the Manslayer."

00:45:02.125 --> 00:45:04.208
Something psychological?

00:45:06.208 --> 00:45:08.916
Insomnia. Heart pounding. Shaky hands…

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.958
Plenty lost their minds
after the Boshin War.

00:45:15.333 --> 00:45:18.791
But if you're planning
to survive with that little miss,

00:45:18.875 --> 00:45:20.583
you'd better start killing.

00:45:24.166 --> 00:45:26.833
Well, it's up to you.

00:45:28.083 --> 00:45:28.916
Wait.

00:45:32.583 --> 00:45:34.041
Thank you.

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:39.333
Hang in there. I'm rooting for you.

00:45:47.125 --> 00:45:47.958
254

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.208
We're running straight to the gate.

00:45:55.458 --> 00:45:56.458
Okay.

00:46:37.166 --> 00:46:38.916
You go first. Hurry!

00:46:40.541 --> 00:46:41.666
Go!

00:47:41.833 --> 00:47:43.083
You bastard.

00:47:48.583 --> 00:47:49.458
Bastard!

00:48:27.208 --> 00:48:30.833
Well done.
Please show me your wooden tags.

00:48:44.625 --> 00:48:46.166
Thank you for helping me.

00:48:46.958 --> 00:48:49.791
We're going to a friend's inn. Stay alert.

00:48:51.708 --> 00:48:52.750
Confirmed.

00:48:56.833 --> 00:48:58.083
Safe journey.

00:49:38.375 --> 00:49:40.125
It's started to rain.

00:49:41.625 --> 00:49:43.500
It certainly has.

00:49:45.833 --> 00:49:47.833
Number 108, Shujiro Saga,

00:49:47.916 --> 00:49:51.208
and number 120, Futaba Katsuki,
have made it through.

00:49:52.125 --> 00:49:56.166
Shujiro Saga,
the Kokushu the Manslayer, huh?

00:49:56.708 --> 00:49:58.916
With a child in tow.

00:49:59.458 --> 00:50:01.666
Now this is getting interesting!

00:50:03.916 --> 00:50:06.125
May I have a moment
of your time, everyone?

00:50:06.208 --> 00:50:08.750
What is it? It was just getting good.

00:50:09.541 --> 00:50:12.291
A letter from the organizer has arrived.

00:50:17.291 --> 00:50:19.291
Allow me to read it for you.

00:50:23.041 --> 00:50:29.750
"To all who have agreed to this Kodoku,
I extend my deepest gratitude."

00:50:31.083 --> 00:50:36.750
"The samurai are capable
of nothing but swinging swords."

00:50:38.416 --> 00:50:43.666
"They mistook privilege for strength."

00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:48.458
"They remain blind to the truth
that the world has moved on without them."

00:50:49.375 --> 00:50:53.250
"They live on in vain
as fools who have lost all meaning."

00:50:54.875 --> 00:51:00.958
"Now let us enjoy this game
and bring ruin to the ghosts

00:51:01.791 --> 00:51:05.916
who still call themselves samurai."

00:51:18.416 --> 00:51:19.750
Stop!

00:51:33.583 --> 00:51:37.458
It's been a while, hasn't it, Kokushu?

00:51:38.708 --> 00:51:40.416
Bukotsu Kanjiya.

00:51:40.916 --> 00:51:43.291
Has it been ten years?

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:46.333
I've wanted to see you all this time.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.166
I thought I would find you if I came here.

00:51:53.583 --> 00:51:54.750
Come on…

00:51:58.833 --> 00:52:01.875
Kokushu the Manslayer!

00:52:19.208 --> 00:52:23.291
128 REMAINING

00:56:34.958 --> 00:56:38.458
