00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.039
You

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:51.200
never let me rest easy.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.679
You hurt your knee again.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.420
(If my vision hadn't recovered,)

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.060
(I'd have been deceived)

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.040
(by this hypocritical beast forever.)

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.239
(No.)

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.519
(Perhaps once he's officially appointed)

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:09.079
(at tomorrow's meeting,)

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:10.680
(he'll make his move against me.)

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:12.980
(I must find a way to escape.)

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.560
(Now, he's even confiscated my phone.)

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.719
(It seems)

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.939
(I didn't dispel his suspicions.)

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.480
Honey.

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:21.920
I went to see Dad.

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.680
Guess what he told me?

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.040
What did he say?

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:27.400
He said

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:29.200
after this illness,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.319
he truly felt his age.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.120
He could no longer

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.680
protect you.

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:36.840
So he kept pushing me,

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:37.859
telling me

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:39.159
no matter what,

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:41.439
I must treat you exceptionally well

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.439
and cherish you.

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:46.480
Dad's nagging

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:47.560
was quite endearing.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.120
Yes.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.359
Dad's getting old.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.819
The burden from now on

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.480
will fall on your shoulders.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.519
Are you scared?

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:00.040
Of course I am.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:01.560
Actually,

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:03.519
I've always known deep down

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.719
no matter how hard I tried before,

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.959
Dad

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.000
never truly approved of me.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.599
I wish I could tear out
my heart to show him

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:13.199
and let him see

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.659
how deeply I love you.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.159
But I know

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:17.479
any words

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:18.560
would be inadequate.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.780
Let time be the proof.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.800
Darling,

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.199
thank you.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.400
The family's burden

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.560
will fall to you.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.000
Oh, dear.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.000
I want

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.580
to discuss something with you.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.400
What is it?

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:34.680
These past few days,

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:36.259
I've been thinking deeply.

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:38.699
I fully recognize your capabilities,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.520
but given your experience level,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.759
becoming Jiuyao Group's CEO

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:44.780
would likely draw criticism.

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:46.919
So,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.080
I want to transfer

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.939
all my shares to you.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.120
This way,

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.020
we can silence the naysayers.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.080
(She's willing to give me
all her Jiuyao shares?)

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.699
(That's an enormous fortune.)

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.759
(Just giving it away like this?)

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.139
Honey.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.840
You're not joking, are you?

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.620
This vast wealth

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.460
is everything you have.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.639
Darling,

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:11.159
for you,

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:13.039
I'd give everything.

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:14.780
But

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.819
you won't betray me, will you?

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.280
Honey.

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:21.439
I would never betray you.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.120
Compared to these material possessions,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.759
you're my everything.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.000
(You don't know yet)

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:31.500
(your shares)

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.460
(are being transferred now.)

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:36.659
(Ye Dong,)

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.879
(I'll dedicate everything I have)

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.000
(to crush you completely.)

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.900
Stop.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.560
Where are you going

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.840
so late at night?

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.599
Going to change clothes.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.080
I can't stand

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:06.360
this stench of blood.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.240
We'll dispose of the body tonight.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.800
Why bother with extra steps?

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:13.039
Unless

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.039
you're planning something?

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:16.279
Of course not.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.279
We've been subordinates all the time.

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:19.639
Dong's rise to power

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:21.639
is our chance to turn the tables.

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:23.480
If tonight,

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:25.379
you make any moves,

00:04:25.579 --> 00:04:27.500
don't blame me for being merciless.

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:28.800
Of course,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.899
we're now bound by shared interests.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.259
Miss Qin,

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.420
in that case,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.819
I can rest assured.

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:37.720
Didn't you just say

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.439
you were going to change clothes?

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.639
Should I

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.600
accompany you

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.120
to check

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.000
if they fit?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.600
Forget it.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.120
No need to go anyway.

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:49.480
Ms. Lin has so many beautiful outfits,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.040
and they're all mine to wear now.

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.060
Sooner or later, I'll have you.

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:18.399
Honey,

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:20.079
I accidentally

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.279
stained my clothes.

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:23.060
I'll go shower.

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:24.500
Go ahead.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.360
(Beast.)

00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:08.860
(Worse than an animal.)

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.120
(In this house where my dad just died,)

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.540
(after I just
handed over all my shares,)

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.439
(under the watch of your blind wife,)

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.360
(how dare you)

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.540
(be so brazenly shameless?)

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.680
(Ye Dong,)

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:25.459
(your wickedness)

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:28.000
(knows no bottom.)

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.959
Yufei,

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.160
you won't expose me, will you?

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:34.959
How could I?

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:37.000
What good would exposing you do?

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.680
I'm already yours.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.279
We stand or fall together.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.899
Dong,

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:44.360
I'll do anything for you.

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:45.639
But

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.459
you must safeguard my interests.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.240
We are

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.439
cut from the same cloth.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.500
How do we handle those things?

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.160
Tonight,

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.560
let him sink to the ocean floor.

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:42.079
(I want to escape,)

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.800
(but it's near impossible.)

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.339
(Seems)

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.120
(my only hope lies with Na now.)

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.399
Master,

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.439
Bai Cha's real name is Zhang Susu.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.819
She was the Phantom Club's top DJ.

00:07:58.199 --> 00:07:59.120
Extremely popular.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.220
Ye Dong worked as their security guard.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.079
They dated briefly.

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:05.240
Rumor says Ye Dong even slit his wrist

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.120
for Bai Cha's sake.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.800
Ye Dong's actions

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.000
terrified Bai Cha,

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:10.360
so she left quietly.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.560
Later,

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:12.519
Bai Cha

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.480
met Cheng Nuo,

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.540
and they fell in love.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.660
Meanwhile, Ye Dong married

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.720
into the Lin family.

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:20.040
I remember now.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:20.759
No wonder

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.959
he looked familiar.

00:08:22.279 --> 00:08:23.480
I once handled

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.480
a nightclub brawl case

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.519
where he was involved.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.240
Ye Dong hid

00:08:28.379 --> 00:08:29.660
his history with Bai Cha,

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.480
seemingly to

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:33.100
cut ties with

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:33.960
his past self.

00:08:34.519 --> 00:08:35.240
Then why

00:08:35.639 --> 00:08:37.120
keep entangling with Bai Cha?

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:40.039
Isn't this

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.240
the unattainable

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.480
always stirring desire?

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.039
What I can't obtain,

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:47.879
I'll destroy it.

00:08:48.039 --> 00:08:49.240
There's more to this story.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.440
Are you certain

00:08:50.799 --> 00:08:52.720
Bai Cha fell accidentally?

00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:54.240
Did she personally tell you?

00:08:54.519 --> 00:08:55.200
It was her.

00:08:55.399 --> 00:08:56.440
I've verified it.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.580
But when you verified it,

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.960
was it truly her?

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.120
Yes, it was her.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:02.919
But

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:03.960
her head was bandaged.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.519
If I find any random woman

00:09:06.759 --> 00:09:07.600
with bandages,

00:09:09.039 --> 00:09:10.220
you wouldn't be able to tell

00:09:10.679 --> 00:09:11.600
if it's Bai Cha, right?

00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:13.320
I probably can't tell.

00:09:16.519 --> 00:09:18.519
This is what I call meticulousness?

00:09:18.799 --> 00:09:20.320
You didn't even verify her identity?

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.000
M-M-Master.

00:09:22.299 --> 00:09:23.159
I was wrong.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.279
Don't mess up!

00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:32.120
It smells amazing, Mom.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.159
Since childhood,

00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:34.659
I've loved your meatball soup.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:35.899
Take your time.

00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:38.000
I made plenty today.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:38.960
Lin Xia,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.159
have some, too.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:51.879
Honey,

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.120
you okay?

00:09:53.879 --> 00:09:55.000
It's inconvenient for you.

00:09:55.399 --> 00:09:56.240
Let me feed you.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.600
Lin Xia,

00:10:16.919 --> 00:10:17.840
why are you shaking?

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:19.879
Is my cooking that disgusting?

00:10:20.679 --> 00:10:21.279
Honey,

00:10:21.639 --> 00:10:23.480
check if my hand's burned.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:25.600
It's fine.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:26.960
Honey,

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.240
eat the meatball first.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.159
I'll tend to your burn.

00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:32.720
I really can't eat.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.840
This is

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.120
my first time cooking for you.

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:36.559
You won't even humor me?

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:38.759
Looking down on me?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:40.519
Mom,

00:10:41.559 --> 00:10:42.279
it's not that.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:44.340
I...

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:46.519
I...

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.360
Here.

00:12:24.159 --> 00:12:24.840
Honey,

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.480
are you done?

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.679
Lin Na's here.

00:12:29.919 --> 00:12:30.740
Na.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.139
(Na's my lifeline.)

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:36.399
(I must get her to call the police.)

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.120
I'm fine.

00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:43.200
Just

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.919
a sudden stomachache.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.240
Feeling nauseous.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:49.840
Okay.

00:12:50.679 --> 00:12:51.120
No rush.
