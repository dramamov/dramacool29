Dad

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:45.000
She's crawling over here

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.279
Xiaoman

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.839
Xiaoman

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:24.279
Dear

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:27.440
Is that you

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.040
You're back

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:37.080
Dear

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:39.839
D-don't scare me

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.000
It was just a dream

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.559
Scared me to death

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:02.959
Xiaoman

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:07.440
Husband

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.240
Help me

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.119
Dear

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.320
Is that you

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.679
Dong Dachang

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:24.600
I-I didn't mean to

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:25.639
I'll burn paper for you

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:26.440
I'll burn it for you

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.119
Spare me

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.639
Let me go

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:28.160
Let go

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:30.160
Dong Dachang

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.240
I didn't mean to

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.440
I'll burn money, give you money

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.919
Please let me go

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.919
Dong Dachang

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.600
Let me go

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.479
I didn't mean to

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:39.240
I didn't mean it

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.679
Please let me go

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.440
Such a strong opium smell

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.559
Dong Dachang

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:45.000
He must be hallucinating

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.479
Let me go, let me go

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:48.240
I'll burn paper, I'll burn money for you

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:00.320
Ghost!

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.320
Who are you

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:07.160
Xiaoman

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.600
Xiulan

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:09.639
Stop howling

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:11.559
There's no one here but you

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.679
What's going on

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.839
Could it be

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.440
Dong Dachang

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.600
Dong Dachang

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.440
Did you kill Dong Dachang

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.679
Why

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.919
You all

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.800
It's not my business

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.240
I didn't do anything

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:33.600
It's not my fault

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.240
We're from the authorities

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.919
Dong Dachang's body

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:38.800
is at the yamen right now

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:41.160
His wages from yesterday are with you

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:43.960
And you just admitted killing Dong Dachang

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.880
No use arguing

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:46.320
What exactly happened

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.039
Speak quickly

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.240
Don't make me use force

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:52.199
I slipped up

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.800
It's all him

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:56.399
If he hadn't meddled

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:57.720
I wouldn't have ended up like this

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.240
Someone's stealing

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.000
Stop

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.880
Stop

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:12.600
It's you

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.919
Zhang Shuisheng

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.320
How could you steal

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.279
I-I

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.720
Brother Dong

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.359
I won't dare next time

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:21.480
Brother Dong

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.600
Please have mercy

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.559
Let me go

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:24.399
Otherwise

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.440
Xiulan

00:04:25.679 --> 00:04:27.600
My son Xiaoman won't survive

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.440
Brother Dong

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.480
You had a daughter too

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.480
It's hard enough for poor folks like us

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.799
We can't lose a father too

00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:41.000
Brother Dong, Brother Dong

00:04:44.119 --> 00:04:45.040
Just this once

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:46.320
Next time with someone else

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.720
You won't be so lucky

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.320
Get lost

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.839
Where's the thief

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.720
Sir

00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:01.519
Thanks to you

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.519
Kind soul

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:04.559
So it was you

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.480
This is Dachang from the East Cloth Shop

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:08.320
He once saved a drowning child

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:09.559
That was my nephew

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.399
I remember that

00:05:10.799 --> 00:05:11.200
I remember

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.720
Heard you were always kind

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.640
Always doing good deeds

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:15.760
Just because he caught you robbing

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:17.040
He didn't turn you in

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.279
He was kind enough

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.959
Yet you still killed him

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:22.279
Kind enough

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.880
He used that against me

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:25.880
Always watching me

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:27.079
What's it to him how my family is

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:28.440
What's it got to do with him

00:05:29.239 --> 00:05:30.399
He can't get enough of being good

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.959
There are plenty he could help

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:33.399
Why focus on me

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:35.160
He had bad intentions

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:36.559
He had bad intentions

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.399
Shuisheng

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:41.640
What did you promise me

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.320
What about Xiaoman and Xiulan

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.320
Quit pretending

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.160
You think I don't know

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:52.959
You used to be a gambler too

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:53.519
You

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:55.920
Lost all your money

00:05:56.239 --> 00:05:57.480
Let your sick child die

00:05:57.679 --> 00:05:58.799
Your wife left too

00:05:59.119 --> 00:06:00.279
And you still meddle in my life

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.519
Stop right there

00:06:04.359 --> 00:06:05.200
If you go in again

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.720
I'll tell Xiulan

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:09.040
Get out of my way

00:06:09.679 --> 00:06:10.839
Don't block my comeback

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.320
If you don't pay in three days

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.760
You'll lose your life

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.600
Get lost

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.799
Dong Dachang

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.720
You like snitching, huh

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:28.160
Fine

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.160
Since you love being a good guy

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:33.399
I'll help you out then

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.679
If he hadn't snitched

00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:07.079
I'd have won it all back

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:08.880
All on six

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.920
All on six

00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:19.679
Why are you gambling again

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:21.559
-The kids can't eat -Just this round

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.200
Stop gambling.

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:31.839
Everyone, stop gambling.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.959
That day at the pai gow table,

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:35.200
it was clearly a Supreme Pair.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.959
My wife suddenly barged in.

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:38.279
She pleaded like she was mourning.

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:39.720
She brought all the bad luck.

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:42.000
That thirty taels of gambling debt—

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.679
he deserved to pay it back.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.559
I—I know.

00:07:46.359 --> 00:07:47.320
Dong Dachang, these past years,

00:07:48.119 --> 00:07:49.160
saved up quite a bit of money.

00:07:49.359 --> 00:07:50.519
I wanted to rob him.

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:51.799
I waited outside.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.519
But the cold wind sobered me up.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.799
I was about to leave.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:58.880
But...

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.040
he came out right then.

00:08:02.799 --> 00:08:03.519
That day,

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.760
it was already late.

00:08:07.359 --> 00:08:08.760
No one was on the road.

00:08:26.679 --> 00:08:27.839
I’ll earn merit for you.

00:08:28.079 --> 00:08:29.440
Send you to enter Nirvana early.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:36.679
Let go.

00:08:37.479 --> 00:08:38.080
Let go.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.320
You beast.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.640
I could kill you right now.

00:08:52.919 --> 00:08:54.400
Dong Dachang forced me into this.

00:08:54.799 --> 00:08:56.679
Where did you go after killing yesterday?

00:08:56.919 --> 00:08:58.159
Did you see Xiulan?

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.280
When did Xiaoman go missing?

00:09:02.479 --> 00:09:03.320
That day,

00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:05.080
I stole the money,

00:09:05.159 --> 00:09:05.719
bought some things,

00:09:05.719 --> 00:09:06.799
then went home.

00:09:07.159 --> 00:09:08.200
Xiulan wasn’t home.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:10.640
Xiaoman was home.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.200
Xiaoman was always at home.

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:13.960
Xiao... Xiaoman.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.599
Just now, Xiaoman—

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.799
was just sitting there.

00:09:20.719 --> 00:09:21.239
But...

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.440
Suddenly, the portrait came alive.

00:09:24.039 --> 00:09:24.880
Dong Dachang’s ghost appeared.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.599
Dong Dachang’s ghost appeared.

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:28.719
That’s an opium hallucination.

00:09:29.239 --> 00:09:30.919
Are you sure Xiaoman was always home?

00:09:31.479 --> 00:09:32.359
Xiaoman.

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:36.000
Xiaoman was home.

00:09:37.119 --> 00:09:38.679
Xiaoman was always home.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.880
Xiulan wasn’t there.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.679
Xiulan.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.880
She didn’t come home all night.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.559
Guards!

00:09:48.239 --> 00:09:49.440
Take him to the yamen first.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.679
Let’s go check Dong Dachang’s body.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:56.799
Prince.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.799
The body—

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.200
there’s a problem.

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:05.520
What exactly happened?

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.960
Prince, please calm your anger.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.119
We found the body not far from the corner.

00:10:10.119 --> 00:10:11.239
We discovered this corpse.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.320
He probably crawled there himself.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.719
But he died soon after.

00:10:15.119 --> 00:10:17.400
We found this bundle beside the body.

00:10:17.559 --> 00:10:19.760
I hurried to report to you, Prince.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.039
So I didn’t look closely.

00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:22.320
I ran to find you.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.559
Let go of me! Let go!

00:10:29.919 --> 00:10:32.119
Zhang Shuisheng, look carefully.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.400
Is this Dong Dachang whom you killed yesterday?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.760
Are you sure?

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.080
I saw Dong Dachang with my own eyes,

00:10:46.239 --> 00:10:47.440
wearing this raincoat.

00:10:48.119 --> 00:10:48.840
In the bag, there’s also—

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.640
his Longevity Amulet he always wore.

00:10:51.559 --> 00:10:52.440
I couldn’t be mistaken.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.719
What about his build?

00:10:55.599 --> 00:10:57.880
Don’t you think he’s much thinner now?

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.640
Wearing these clothes—

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.880
and it was pouring rain.

00:11:06.559 --> 00:11:07.799
Couldn’t see clearly.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.080
But...

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.239
Isn’t this Dong Dachang?

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.799
I followed him all the way here.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.320
Saw him enter the dye house.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.119
See for yourself.

00:11:18.039 --> 00:11:19.280
See who you killed.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.440
Xiulan.

00:11:41.039 --> 00:11:42.320
What’s going on?

00:11:43.359 --> 00:11:45.119
Why is it you?

00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:47.960
Did you know Xiulan is pregnant with your child?

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.880
If not for the unborn child,

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.000
she wouldn’t have to endure you.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.840
Impossible. Impossible.

00:12:03.479 --> 00:12:05.640
What is happening?

00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:09.159
Xiulan, tell me.

00:12:09.359 --> 00:12:10.159
Tell me.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.719
Tell me.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.679
Tell me.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:13.799
Xiulan.

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:14.840
Where is Xiaoman?

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.239
He even killed the wrong person.

00:12:18.719 --> 00:12:20.280
He probably really doesn’t know where Xiaoman is.

00:12:21.479 --> 00:12:24.119
Xiulan’s obsession must be tied to Xiaoman’s illness.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.320
If we delay, we won’t be able to solve it.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.200
The dream we finally captured—

00:12:28.359 --> 00:12:29.760
will be wasted just like that.
