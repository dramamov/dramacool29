(Yu Yu Design Studio)

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.860
(Look, what kind of hat did Mr. Yu buy?)

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.220
(Do you think
he'll actually wear this out?)

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.070
(Not just out.)

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.540
(Look.)

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.300
Mr. Yu.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.350
Speak.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.140
You actually wore that thing
to work this morning?

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.830
This is called a hat.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.140
Yes, a hat.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.020
But the color of that hat of yours...

00:02:43.462 --> 00:02:44.740
Forget it, I won't say it.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.740
Just say it.

00:02:49.573 --> 00:02:51.390
Why would a single man wear a green hat?

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.140
(Printing)

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.510
You dare laugh?

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.270
I didn't laugh.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.420
I was thinking of Xiaoxiao.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.020
Xiaoxiao was amazing yesterday.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.020
She figured out
from Xia Xiaoman's outfit

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.550
that she's really broke.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.350
Is Xia Xiaoman really broke now?

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.300
I couldn't tell at all.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.980
Ms. Lin.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.630
Goodness.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.020
Why would you wear a green hat
when you're single?

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.020
Oh dear.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.830
My great designer Yu.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.670
You not only changed the materials,

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.230
but you also
adjusted some of the design,

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.350
and lowered the cost.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.990
You even kept the open kitchen.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.070
You're wonderful.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.580
Really?

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.700
You would revise your own design?

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.570
Why?

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.020
To help them live better,

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.860
and to help you earn a bit more bonus.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.550
I was wrong, Mr. Yu.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.860
You really do have a kind heart.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.420
Of course, his heart is the warmest.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.740
Right.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.070
Do you think this hat looks good on me?

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.270
Look at that green.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.950
That green is really something.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.706
- Right?
- It even matches your outfit.

00:04:17.706 --> 00:04:19.590
Wu, you really should wear it.

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.430
No need, Ms. Lin.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.570
My green shirt is enough.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.151
Alright, fine, it looks good.

00:04:23.173 --> 00:04:25.350
I'm telling you,
green hats are all the rage this year.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.550
We won't wear them,
won't wear anything green.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.060
(Hahaha)

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.300
What are you laughing at? So happy?

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.140
Come look.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.990
I sent Mr. Yu's hat photo to Wu.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.180
He made a meme out of it.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.860
Wu is too talented.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.830
Any more?

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.740
Should I make a group chat?

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.300
I'll ask him to make more and send them.

00:04:48.306 --> 00:04:49.060
Yes.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.350
Are we being too mean?

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.350
How could we be?

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.500
He's annoying.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.710
He deserves a bit of teasing.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.860
(Select contacts.
Gu Yejia, Qing, Wang Xiaoxiao, Shen Wu)

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.900
(Xia Xiaoman
invites you to a group chat)

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.420
(What should we name the group?)

00:05:05.928 --> 00:05:07.150
(Let's call it the Idle Group.)

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.550
(Good name.)

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.420
(Idle Group.)

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.030
Here's your 10,000.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.550
I borrowed that 10,000
to invest in my friend's restaurant.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.030
(Ma's Roast Lamb Leg)

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.150
This card counts as the interest.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.790
All the vegetarian dishes are free.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.350
Ma's Roast Lamb Leg.

00:05:44.506 --> 00:05:45.710
Vegetarian dishes are free?

00:05:45.951 --> 00:05:47.180
Am I supposed to eat cumin?

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:48.500
Listen to yourself.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.817
Who said you have to eat spices?

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.470
Hey, hey.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.820
Yu, could you lend me another 10,000?

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.060
It's just that this month...

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.551
I have over a dozen weddings
and funerals to give gifts to.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.060
I really can't keep up.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.990
Hmph.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.060
Pointless social rituals.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.500
What are you counting?

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.380
Exactly 10,000.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:08.630
Here's 9,000.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.380
What?

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.528
Nine out, and thirteen back.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:12.710
You owe me 13,000.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.230
You're ruthless.

00:06:14.373 --> 00:06:15.751
We're real brothers.

00:06:15.795 --> 00:06:17.662
Even if you were my own dad,
no exception.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.350
Mom, Dad has money now.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.180
Ha ha.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.070
Hey.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.030
2,000 a month for your allowance
still isn't enough?

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.150
It really isn't.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.060
There are too many dinners to attend.

00:06:57.373 --> 00:06:58.940
Our daughter wants to learn piano.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.150
What do you think?

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.790
Why not violin?

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.030
Mom can teach her, and it's free.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.030
The issue is that your niece
isn't interested.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:10.860
Piano is good.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.230
She might even be a musician
in the future.

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:14.590
Right?

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.620
Right, I agree.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.500
So, between your daughter's future
and eating out with friends,

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:21.910
which matters more?

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.620
Her future matters more, of course.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.230
Congratulations, you fell right in.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.300
The piano lesson fee.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.150
You can cover it.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:41.670
How much is it?

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.300
500 per lesson.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:44.670
20 lessons in total.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.910
This is what marriage is.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.260
A constant game of strategy, right?

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:03.750
Thanks.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:05.910
Hey.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:08.110
My money.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:20.470
The piano lesson fee

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.017
will come out of your allowance.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:23.260
Wait...

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:29.420
Even less allowance now.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:30.940
And you still owe me 4,000.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:31.910
What?

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:33.950
I'm calling the police.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.310
Your Macallan Impression.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.220
Please.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.190
Thank you.

00:08:59.262 --> 00:09:00.500
A little surprise for you.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.110
A small gift.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:03.270
Do you like it?

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.380
This necklace is lovely.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.540
It suits you.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:13.110
I think so.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:14.660
It looks so nice.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.860
Can I show it off to my friends?

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:17.780
Go on.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.140
I'll excuse myself then.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:19.980
Alright.

00:09:26.351 --> 00:09:27.710
What are you drinking today?

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:30.350
The usual.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:31.190
Alright.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.860
A new girlfriend again?

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.430
She isn't my girlfriend.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.230
We just met by chance.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.510
With no pressure between us,

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.020
we're having a small adventure.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.990
Of course, this adventure

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.430
doesn't have to involve
the same person every time.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.230
You're really philosophical.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:50.620
You need experience.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.230
When you have had enough of it,

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.470
you can find answers in the adventure.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.260
So, can you tell me

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.310
what the answer is now?

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.020
I think it might be money.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.950
Take that girl just now.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.780
She's actually a flight attendant.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.540
I met her on a flight to Paris.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.230
To make sure we could talk quietly,

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.706
I booked the entire first class cabin
on the way back.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.860
So money brought you love.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.470
Smart. That's for you.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.070
Thanks.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.500
And now it brings my gratitude
and respect for you as well.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:29.950
Beer promotion.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.310
Come take a look.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.380
Come on, have a look.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.230
It's a great deal right now.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:35.500
Come on, look.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.260
It's a great deal. Have a drink.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.660
What do you think?

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.990
Harley, the hurdle men
can't seem to cross.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.430
Have a beer instead.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.590
Sit and take your time.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:48.740
Aren't you cold?

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.900
I am, but if you buy a beer,

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.595
I'll be so happy that I won't feel cold.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:54.500
Give me a dozen.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.900
Sure, come inside.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.310
Hello, everyone.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.860
If you like our beer, give it a try.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:00.950
This one,

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.350
strawberry beer.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:03.190
It's great.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.710
And we have promotions now.

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:06.440
Alright, you go somewhere else first.

00:11:06.462 --> 00:11:07.660
- We'll look around.
- Sure.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.220
No problem. Please enjoy.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:14.900
Let's pack it instead.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.990
No problem.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:17.260
Add me on WeChat.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.020
I'll take you out for skewers tonight.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:20.740
I'll cover the drinks, alright?

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:21.860
Add me then.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.500
Cheers.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.500
Have one.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.710
Why are you ignoring me?

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:28.550
Have a drink.

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.830
No, enjoy your night.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.110
What's that attitude?

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.620
That little butt is really perky. Nice.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:36.980
Say that again.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:45.190
What's that attitude?

00:11:45.462 --> 00:11:46.950
Believe it or not, I'll report you.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:49.950
This flat of yours...

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:52.430
Do you have to pay
the service charge every month?

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.460
Yes.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.310
How much?

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:55.150
1,000.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:56.860
1,000?

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.430
Why is yours 1,000 and mine 4,000?

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.540
(Credits)

00:12:19.351 --> 00:12:21.190
How long have you been
standing behind me?

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:22.710
About ten seconds.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.070
Why didn't you say anything?

00:12:24.128 --> 00:12:25.260
I was afraid I'd startle you.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.420
You might choke while eating.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:27.780
That's considerate.

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:28.790
Sit.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:34.150
What's wrong now?

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.590
Oh, my duodenum hurts a bit.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.020
That's your stomach.

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:40.500
Then, it's stomach pain.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.020
Any other symptoms?

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.830
Dizziness and nausea.

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:46.620
My vision's a bit blurry.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:47.860
Alright.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.595
I'll prescribe you something
to clear your head when I get to work.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.070
Right.

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:54.230
I saw Ms. Lin yesterday.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:55.670
Lin Sa?

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:56.670
Where?

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:58.540
In a bedroom.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:06.110
Oh, sorry.

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:10.350
Dr. Gu.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.070
Ms. Lin.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.370
So, what brings you here today?

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:18.520
Buying a flat or planning a renovation?

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.230
I just want to redo our home.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.950
Came to look at the show flats.

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:22.900
See if I get any ideas.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.020
Renovating?

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.110
Then you should come to me.

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.230
Renovation takes time.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:28.310
You can't rush it.

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:29.900
Look around, and compare more.

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:31.740
Follow your own style.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.195
Pick slowly, and choose what you like.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.740
She said you cut the cost

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.070
and still met the client's needs.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.230
The client was thrilled.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.590
Said the money saved
could go to hiring a carer

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:41.830
to look after their ill mother.

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.860
That would ease the wife's burden.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.660
You really did something wonderful.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:47.070
It's nothing.

00:13:47.484 --> 00:13:48.862
Just saving them a bit of money.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.190
Money, when used well,

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.830
can bring people joy.

00:13:53.973 --> 00:13:55.528
It can even improve relationships.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.500
What is it?

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:22.430
Your dog was loud tonight.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:24.700
Oh.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.900
I worked late.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.500
Didn't have time to walk it.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.430
Sorry.

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:30.710
Selling cars at 10 at night?

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.430
It's a part-time job selling beer.

00:14:36.817 --> 00:14:38.380
Can't afford the service charge, right?

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.660
Even with that job,

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:46.780
three more of those won't cover it.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.660
Then I'll just have to move out.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:14:59.660
Alright then.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.230
What's this?

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:24.030
Money.

00:15:25.262 --> 00:15:26.500
Why are you giving me money?

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.190
I know you like this flat.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:30.470
And I know

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:32.860
how important a home is to someone.

00:15:33.284 --> 00:15:35.540
Especially for someone
drifting alone like you.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.260
Stop selling beer.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.950
That way, the customers
will be happier too.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.310
I saw those men

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:49.150
harassing you.

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:51.620
You glared at them fiercely.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.900
As if you'd smash a bottle on them.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:56.340
Let me tell you.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.190
You can't beat those young girls.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.620
They know how to please customers.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.540
If you really want to sell beer,

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.062
you might as well livestream.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:06.310
They can't touch you,

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:08.070
and you get beauty filters.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.380
A few years later, when you've aged,

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:11.780
they won't notice.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:16.430
I don't usually spend much.

00:16:16.751 --> 00:16:18.350
I just end up buying useless things.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.540
Buying rubbish

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:22.030
or giving it to you

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.030
is all the same.

00:16:23.128 --> 00:16:24.795
Either way makes no difference to me.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.860
At least you'll say thank you.

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:28.020
But I think

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:29.780
the money I'm giving you

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.230
feels worthwhile to me.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.110
It gives me a sense of helping someone.

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:35.790
But don't worry.

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.310
I don't need your thanks.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.470
Using this money

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:41.260
to find some sense of achievement in me?

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.100
Does that amuse you?

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.430
You mock me,

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.350
belittle me,

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.110
and call me ugly for fun?

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.110
Is that fun?

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.350
- I...
- Useless!

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:34.300
Don't panic. Listen to me.

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:35.910
Hold him from behind.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.740
Make a fist with one hand, palm in.

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:39.740
Place it between his navel and ribs.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:41.740
Use your other hand to grip your wrist.

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:43.540
Push inward and upward.

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:44.380
Alright, I'll try.

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.910
He spat it out.

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:48.020
Great, it's out.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:50.910
Call 120 now.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:51.862
Have the hospital check

00:17:51.862 --> 00:17:53.299
- whether his oesophagus is scratched.
- Alright.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.540
Call me if anything happens.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:55.900
- Alright, Dr. Gu.
- Bye.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:00.230
Are you mad?

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:01.740
Why sneak behind me to scare me?

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:03.020
The Heimlich manoeuvre.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.390
Someone choked on something?

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:09.630
A friend tried biting off
a beer bottle cap

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:10.780
and swallowed it.

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:13.500
Your friends are that childish?

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:16.940
Except me.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.500
What are you even here for?

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.100
I booked your slot for tomorrow.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:24.340
But I couldn't wait.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:25.940
What now?

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:29.190
Something scared me.

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:30.910
My appendix cramped a bit.

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.500
But your record says your appendix

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.820
was removed seven or eight years ago.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.390
Why did you memorize my record?

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.780
Tell me what guilty thing you did.

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:46.030
It's your fault.

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:48.100
You told me

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.870
money can improve relationships.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.950
Mr. Yu Yu told me

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.990
you need money lately.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.260
Why would he tell you that?

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:16.500
So annoying.

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:18.710
He meant well.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:23.020
No. I don't need
his condescending sympathy.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.260
It only makes me feel smaller.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.180
Wait.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:28.230
Hold on.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.340
Take this.

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:35.950
Return them when you can.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.670
No, I don't need them.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.740
I've already made up my mind.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:42.310
Well,

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.580
if I can't afford this flat,

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:45.780
I'll move.

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:47.500
If I can't survive in this city,

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:48.910
I'll leave.

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:50.430
No need to be that grim.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.990
It's called knowing my limit.

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.060
Are you sure about this?

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.100
I'm sure.

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.580
But I still don't get

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.230
why Yu Yu pays 1,000

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:01.740
and mine is 4,000.

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:02.710
What?

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:11.820
Hello, who's this?

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:14.500
Your neighbour, Yu Yu.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:15.340
Don't hang up.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:16.950
Or it'll be worse.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:19.540
What did I do to you now?

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.928
I'm already in America.
Why are you still bothering me?

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.430
I heard you told your niece Xia Xiaoman

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:25.710
to pay your fine.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.830
Right?

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:28.950
What's that got to do with you?

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.140
Hmph.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.950
You expanded your flat illegally

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:33.084
and did random renovations,

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.395
which ruined the soundproofing.

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:36.100
You're selfish and inconsiderate.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.262
You even asked the management
to split your fine

00:20:38.262 --> 00:20:39.540
and made your niece pay it.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.920
Are you even worthy of being an uncle?
Do you have a conscience?

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.540
She's out selling beer at night now,

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.060
hungry and freezing to pay your fine.

00:20:45.062 --> 00:20:46.300
Are you worthy of being a man?

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.150
I'm warning you.

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.670
Carry your own burden.

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:51.230
Or deal with the consequences.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:52.380
That's it.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:01.670
My uncle.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:04.820
He apologized to me.

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:08.780
He said he'd mixed the fine
into the service fee

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.100
and forgot the installment plan.

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:15.230
And he said he paid the fine.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.470
He even paid this year's service fee.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:18.630
That's great.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.390
Wait...

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:21.340
That means

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.340
I can keep living here.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:24.660
Congratulations.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.910
I still have to put up
with that annoying man.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:52.390
Annoying is annoying,

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.540
but he's a good person.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:57.910
He gave you the money

00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:59.020
because he cares.

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.820
But I still think the way he shows care

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:02.780
is so awkward.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:03.950
A bit condescending.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:04.820
Quite arrogant.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.373
He thinks he's better than everyone.

00:22:06.417 --> 00:22:07.540
Arrogant for no reason.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:08.830
No wonder he can't find a wife.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:10.190
Serves him right to stay single.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.220
Are we being too harsh,

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.260
cursing him like this?

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.140
Not at all.

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.670
This is the trouble
he brought on himself.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:21.820
Honestly,

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:24.150
every time I see his icy face,

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:25.870
I get a bit nervous.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:28.260
I just feel like

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:29.540
avoiding him.

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:30.950
What's there to be afraid of?

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:34.020
Listen, the reason he puts himself

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.060
on a pedestal

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.230
is because only that way

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:37.820
does he feel safe.

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:39.500
In fact,

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.100
he's timid inside.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.820
He hides his fear behind arrogance.

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.740
Listen, next time you see him,

00:22:48.773 --> 00:22:50.430
just think of him as a pot of flowers.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.260
Or think of him as Dao.

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:56.500
You can even tease him a little.

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:38.260
Wait, hold on.

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:40.060
Hey, wait a second.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:43.950
Are you avoiding me?

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.300
No.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.300
Then what's wrong?

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.190
Nothing.

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:48.310
Bye.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:50.900
Wait.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.230
Wait.

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:57.300
My uncle said

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:58.990
you scolded him for twenty minutes.

00:23:59.995 --> 00:24:01.570
It was eight minutes and thirty seconds.

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.300
To be exact, fifty-four seconds from me,

00:24:04.351 --> 00:24:06.195
and seven minutes
thirty-six seconds from him.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.230
And I didn't scold him.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.910
We had a very deep
and honest conversation.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:13.070
Thank you.

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:15.740
Without you,
I'd have moved out long ago.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.260
Then you'd be free
of your annoying neighbor.

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:20.580
I...

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:24.500
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:28.100
It's nothing.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:31.230
See?

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.150
Much better than throwing money at me.

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:36.870
Scientifically speaking,

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.990
everyone is moved by money.

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.340
Your reaction only shows

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:42.950
I gave too little.

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:44.470
If it hadn't been 12,000...

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:45.540
Stop.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.190
Don't ruin my good impression of you.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:52.500
We'll leave, then.

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:02.990
Come in.

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:05.060
Dr. Gu, there's a form

00:25:05.128 --> 00:25:06.390
that needs your signature.

00:25:10.151 --> 00:25:11.630
You had the day off yesterday?

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:13.980
Yes, I went to Jinxi Ancient Town
with a friend.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.870
Come in.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.230
A short trip, just to unwind.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.230
I'll go.

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:29.100
Which bit hurts today,
your heart, liver, spleen,

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:30.270
lungs or kidneys?

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:32.150
First, you're a doctor,

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:33.060
don't jinx me.

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:34.500
Second, I'm not ill this time.

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:36.950
That's why I came
during your lunch break.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.740
What is it? Say it.

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:41.470
Well?

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:43.300
(Shanghai International Fireworks)
You're going to watch fireworks?

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:46.470
What are you actually here for?

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.020
Xia Xiaoman said

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:51.230
she thanked me.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:53.500
Nice work.

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:54.470
I applaud you.

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:57.300
I called her uncle.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.190
Turns out he forgot
about the renovation fine.

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.020
Why was her uncle fined for renovating?

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.020
He shaved a 54 cm wall
down by fourteen centimeters

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:07.670
and replaced the soundproof panels.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:08.950
So the effect got worse.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.100
So Xiaoman's crisis is solved.

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:15.300
That's great.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:16.820
Why are you so happy?

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.260
Her trouble is gone.

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:19.260
Of course, I'm happy.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.020
I've always wondered.

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:23.340
You and Xia Xiaoman

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.260
are nothing alike in age,

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:26.670
vibe or figure.

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:27.910
Why are you two so close?

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:30.910
What's strange about us being close?

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:33.630
I'm a doctor.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:35.950
I deal with life and death every day.

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.190
After work,

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:39.990
I get to see a cheerful, simple girl.

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.870
It makes me happy

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:41.710
and relaxed.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:44.190
And Xiaoman likes cooking.

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:45.580
I like good food.

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:48.100
We can even watch films together.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:49.790
It's great.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:52.180
I get it.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.230
Get what?

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.990
You're pretending
to have a girlish heart.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.500
What's wrong with that?

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:01.430
Why would I pretend?

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:03.060
- Then, you are pretending.
- Get out.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:03.900
Bye.

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.740
Xiaoxiao, let's go out this weekend.

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.260
Where?

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:16.020
Wherever is cheap.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.390
Home is the cheapest.

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:21.470
Right.

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.230
Admin says there are
free Happy Valley tickets.

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:26.070
Want to go?

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:27.300
Why free?

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.020
It's been renovated.

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.500
The free tickets are a promotion.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:34.990
Free tickets.

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:36.190
It'll be packed.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:39.910
Let's go to Happy Valley this weekend.

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:41.100
Okay.

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:46.390
You two carry on.

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:54.990
Ha.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.100
Ha.

00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:58.540
What are you laughing at, Mr. Yu?

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.150
The client wants to change the design.

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:02.060
We start on Monday
and they want changes now?

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.020
Yes.

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.240
That's what I'm laughing at.

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:05.690
What do you mean?

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:06.550
Guess.

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:09.580
We have to work this weekend?

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.390
I don't want to work overtime.

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:17.230
Wrong.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.300
You can't handle
this kind of tight deadline.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.190
You'd only get in the way.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:24.060
According to the negative energy theory,

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.540
you're a negative element.

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:28.100
He means

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.060
you should enjoy your weekend

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.540
and leave the work to him.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:33.910
It's his way of caring for you.

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.340
Really?

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:37.820
Then why can't he just say it nicely?

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:38.990
He's just stubborn.

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:51.140
Wait.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.390
(Next time you see him,
just treat him like Dao.)

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:18.300
(You can even tease him a little.)

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:23.670
Mr. Yu.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:27.940
Good evening.

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:29.870
Just finished work?

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:33.270
What is it?

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.990
Nothing really.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:38.190
I was just being polite
and saying hello.

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.060
From now on, whenever I see you,

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.580
I'll greet you.

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.420
Okay?

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:46.020
Oh.

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:46.860
Here we are.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.190
Goodnight, Mr. Yu.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.390
So strange.

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:02.420
Oh.

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.540
Good morning, Mr. Yu.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:06.420
Morning.

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:10.260
Working on a Saturday as well?

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:12.500
No wonder you're so wealthy.

00:30:13.462 --> 00:30:15.260
Even on holidays,
you're out earning money.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.300
Keep it up.

00:30:58.706 --> 00:30:59.710
I came to check on you.

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:00.820
I'm working.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:01.870
Just drop it and go.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:12.230
Some snacks.

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:17.740
Hey, what are you doing?

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:18.630
You startled me.

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:19.990
A massage gun.

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:22.150
You sit all day and your back aches.

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:23.190
Give it a massage.

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:25.260
What?

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:28.060
The pain is in my back.

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:29.630
I can't reach it on my own.

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:30.630
What's the point then?

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:33.540
Then get yourself a girlfriend.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:34.950
She can help you with it.

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:37.430
You might as well
buy me a massage chair.

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:38.710
Only 18,900 yuan.

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:44.150
If you insist on making me buy it,

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:46.910
I still won't.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:54.884
Hey. Good news.

00:31:54.951 --> 00:31:57.910
The client said no design changes.
You don't need to work overtime.

00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:58.750
What?

00:31:59.084 --> 00:32:00.540
What am I supposed to do then?

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:02.020
Stare into space?

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:04.190
Why don't

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:06.300
you come shooting with me?

00:32:06.995 --> 00:32:08.500
Why would I go shooting with you?

00:32:08.684 --> 00:32:09.870
Get your little boyfriend to go.

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:11.340
The one born in the Year of the Tiger.

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:12.390
We broke up.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.640
I'm seeing someone
born in the Year of the Rabbit now.

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:17.740
Two years ago, you collected
all twelve star signs.

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.950
This year, you're collecting
the zodiac instead?

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.740
What's that supposed to mean?

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.020
What do you mean by "collected"?

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:26.630
I take every relationship seriously.

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:29.500
Anyway,

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.500
I want you to get out more.

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:33.580
Get some fresh air.

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:37.780
And I need a flourishing money tree.

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.100
Design needs creativity.

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:40.740
Go find some inspiration.

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.150
Here we are. Dinner's ready.

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:55.360
- Tissues.
- Sure.

00:32:57.670 --> 00:32:58.510
Mom.

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:02.500
I learn a new piece
in my piano class today.

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:03.340
Did you?

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:05.100
Any reward for me?

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:06.100
Of course.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:07.710
Piano class.

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:09.140
Coward.

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:12.630
Shall we go to Happy Valley tomorrow?

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:14.150
Yes. I love Happy Valley.

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:15.580
Happy Valley.

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:17.500
Newly renovated and reopened.

00:33:17.506 --> 00:33:18.950
They gave out loads of free tickets.

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:20.820
It'll be overflowing with people.

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:23.430
You'll queue for fifty minutes
for five minutes of bumper cars.

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:25.430
Shall we go for a picnic instead?

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:28.500
Find somewhere quiet
and beautiful and set up a tent.

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:30.910
Fly a kite and fish for a bit.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.070
What do you think, Mom?

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:34.060
That sounds good. Nice idea.

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:36.260
Dao, come with us.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.020
What for?

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.910
Tomorrow, I'm sleeping in.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.820
I'll do whatever I want.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.300
Eat what I want.

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:44.670
Buy what I like.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:46.430
That's the joy of being single.

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.060
Jealous?

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:49.710
Jealous.

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:51.470
What are you jealous of?

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.230
We agreed when we got married

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.990
that every weekend,
you'd take the family out.

00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.100
That's your responsibility as a husband.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.780
Yes.

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:02.390
That's the pain of marriage.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:03.580
Right?

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.100
Yes.

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:08.780
(Happy Valley)

00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:10.060
These four tickets are yours.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:12.220
Do you know why it's four?

00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:14.470
Because I figured you wouldn't go.

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:17.470
Then why give them to him?

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.310
He can give them to friends.

00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:21.830
What friends would he have?

00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:23.830
Oh. Right.

00:34:24.528 --> 00:34:25.710
Then I won't give them to you.

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:27.470
I have friends.

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:28.900
Besides,

00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:30.700
I can go alone four times.

00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:32.020
Convinced yet?

00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:35.470
You're so free.

00:34:42.217 --> 00:34:43.700
How about Happy Valley tomorrow?

00:34:43.910 --> 00:34:45.500
They added lots of new rides.

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:47.750
I really think it's a bit pricey.

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:50.580
See you later.

00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:55.270
Hello, Mr. Yu.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:22.380
Hey.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.350
Are you going to Happy Valley?

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:28.100
- What?
- Ah?

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:29.470
You don't like Happy Valley?

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:32.620
No. It's not about the place.

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:34.350
It's that you suddenly asked me.

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:36.830
We're just neighbors.

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:38.060
Why would I invite you?

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.140
Then why ask me?

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.350
Someone shoved four tickets
into my hand.

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:44.910
It felt wasteful to throw them away.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.500
So I thought I'd give them to you.

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:49.700
You can even sell two.

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:50.990
Buy yourself a soda.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:56.540
See you.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.860
(Wooden Coaster)

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:10.470
Wait. Xiaoxiao.

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:13.730
A tiny bag like that is useless.
You won't carry it anyway.

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:14.570
What's wrong?

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:15.620
Can't you hold it for me?

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:18.110
Hey.

00:36:18.706 --> 00:36:20.100
Let's take the roller coaster.

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:22.220
I'm not going.

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.910
I know this one. It's wooden.

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:25.020
It's terrifying.

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:26.180
It's not scary. It's fun.

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:27.500
I'm not going. You go if you want.

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:28.470
Then I'll go myself.

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:29.790
Why? You dare to go?

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:34.380
Wait...

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:35.590
Well...

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:37.910
Hi, Xiaoman.

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:41.310
Hey.

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:45.100
- Hello.
- What a coincidence.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.020
Such a coincidence.

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:47.350
This is my best friend, Qing.

00:36:47.506 --> 00:36:49.500
This is Shen Wu
and his girlfriend, Wang Xiaoxiao.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:50.700
Pleasure to meet you.

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.950
Next time, teach me

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:53.830
that coupon trick.

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:55.270
Sure.

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:57.310
No problem. I'll make sure you learn it.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.870
Hey.

00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:01.060
You're here at Happy Valley too?

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:02.180
Company tickets.

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.580
They're free. Might as well go.

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:08.140
Oh. Your tickets were from Mr. Yu.

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:10.470
He gave you your tickets?

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:12.870
He handed it to me himself.

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:15.350
Amazing.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:16.620
Impressive.

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:19.100
Are you taking the coaster?

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:23.500
Um. I'm not going.

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:24.350
Come on. Join us.

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:25.830
She won't go with me.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:26.790
Come together.

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:33.860
(Shanghai. Kunshan)

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.100
Did I scare you?

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:00.020
Why are you here too?

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:04.180
A short trip. Just relaxing.

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:56.060
(Happy Times)
You...

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:57.580
Oh my goodness.

00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:59.540
She insisted on riding this one.

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:01.870
Honestly.

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:03.790
Here he comes.

00:39:05.795 --> 00:39:07.270
Why do you put yourself through this?

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:08.270
Paying to suffer.

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.990
I didn't pay.

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:14.390
I'm enjoying myself.

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:15.430
Take a break.

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:22.470
Where's my shoe?

00:39:25.884 --> 00:39:27.310
You're watching this drama too?

00:39:28.373 --> 00:39:30.140
I finished all twenty-four episodes.

00:39:30.928 --> 00:39:32.140
Which episode are you on?

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:33.270
Episode twenty-three.

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:34.110
Oh.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:36.350
The guy dies at the end.

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:40.830
Don't worry.

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:42.040
He comes back in season two.

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:44.180
Hello, everyone.

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:47.100
I'm Chunling, your guide
for the Jinxi Ancient Town day tour.

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:48.500
Jinxi Ancient Town

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:51.100
is known as the hometown
of China's folk museums.

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:54.620
It preserves many cultural landmarks
and historical sites.

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:58.310
It's a water town in Jiangnan
with two thousand years of history.

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:00.940
Excuse me.

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.100
That's not quite right.

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:05.220
As far back as 5,500 years ago
in the Songze era,

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.220
the first settlers
were already living in Jinxi.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.840
When King Helv of Wu ordered Wu Zixu

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.840
to build Suzhou
during the Spring and Autumn period,

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.700
this place had already grown
into a market town.

00:40:12.706 --> 00:40:14.484
That was about
2,500 years ago, wasn't it?

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:17.140
I misspoke.

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:18.270
My apologies.

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:22.220
We'll reach Jinjiang Ancient Town soon.

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:25.220
Please take a short break.

00:40:26.062 --> 00:40:27.190
Jinjiang Ancient Town?

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:28.506
Isn't it Jinxi Ancient Town?

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:30.750
Jinxi Ancient Town.

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:34.790
Take a break first.

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:39.390
Mate, you sure know a lot.

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:40.870
How should I address you?

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.580
My surname is Yu.

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:44.500
He didn't ask for your surname.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.750
Where are you two coming from?

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:51.270
Oh. From Shanghai.

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:54.310
Who's a couple with you?

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:56.870
This answer saves trouble.

00:40:59.140 --> 00:40:59.990
Mrs. Yu.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.620
Oh my. You're gorgeous.

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:06.100
I made these sweet potato slices.

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:07.390
They're delicious.

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:09.459
They strengthen the body

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:10.660
and protect the arteries.

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:11.500
Have some.

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:13.270
Thank you.

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:14.270
You're welcome.

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:25.660
It's not just for you.

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:42.310
Morning, Mr. Yu.

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:49.310
Well, since when were you
into motorbikes again?

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:51.100
What would you know?

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:52.620
This is a Harley.

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:54.430
Men never get over it.

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:57.580
Please. There are plenty of things
you can't get over.

00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:14.790
Did you go to Happy Valley?

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:16.270
Yes.

00:42:16.395 --> 00:42:17.500
Did you see Xia Xiaoman?

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:20.100
Yes. Didn't you give her
the tickets yourself?

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:22.020
So you really ran into her.

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:24.140
How was it?

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:28.390
Not bad. We spent
the whole afternoon buying shoes.

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:30.110
What?

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:32.700
We all bought some.

00:42:32.773 --> 00:42:34.020
We even picked a pair for you.

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:35.740
- Here.
- Hey.

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:37.990
Don't ask. I don't want to say anything.

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.140
And you? How was your day yesterday?

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.551
I don't want to talk about it either.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.119
