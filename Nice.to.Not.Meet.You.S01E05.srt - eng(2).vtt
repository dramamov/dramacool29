00:01:16.515 --> 00:01:18.058
This will make you happy.

00:01:18.642 --> 00:01:20.019
I'll only be getting

00:01:20.102 --> 00:01:22.479
half of what you get paid.

00:01:25.274 --> 00:01:27.443
You said you'd do it
for double my pay, remember?

00:01:38.078 --> 00:01:38.913
Let's go.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.793
Hello.

00:01:44.877 --> 00:01:48.255
I'm Gwon Se-na, and I'll be joining
the cast of Good Detective Kang Pil-gu.

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:49.214
Wow!

00:01:58.807 --> 00:02:01.018
About that video I handed over to you…

00:02:01.101 --> 00:02:04.021
There was one more person
who wasn't in it.

00:02:04.104 --> 00:02:06.065
Someone really famous.

00:02:06.774 --> 00:02:08.025
Gwon Se-na.

00:02:11.695 --> 00:02:15.324
I'm just too scared
to keep this to myself.

00:02:21.622 --> 00:02:24.917
POSSIBLE 3RD-PARTY INVOLVEMENT?

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.480
Bro, are you okay?

00:02:46.563 --> 00:02:48.357
What's wrong? Can you not breathe again?

00:02:48.941 --> 00:02:51.151
-Try exhaling.
-It's not that.

00:02:51.235 --> 00:02:52.236
Breathe! Come on!

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.988
I said it's not that!

00:02:54.071 --> 00:02:55.990
It's not that I can't breathe.

00:02:56.573 --> 00:03:01.036
I'm just too pissed off to breathe!

00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:06.000
I only just found out about Se-na myself.

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:07.960
You really didn't know?

00:03:08.043 --> 00:03:09.586
I swear, I didn't know!

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.799
-Why would I risk it and lie to you?
-How the hell could you not know?

00:03:13.882 --> 00:03:16.135
I guess since we turned down the movie,

00:03:16.218 --> 00:03:18.178
they kept it a secret
so it wouldn't fall through again.

00:03:18.262 --> 00:03:20.055
Stop lying!

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.099
Okay, listen to me, bro.

00:03:34.111 --> 00:03:35.029
I'm sorry.

00:03:37.114 --> 00:03:38.949
But I can't film the drama

00:03:40.242 --> 00:03:41.702
with Ms. Gwon Se-na.

00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:44.496
I like Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:03:50.544 --> 00:03:52.296
You know we used to date, right?

00:03:54.423 --> 00:03:55.716
You didn't know?

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:56.967
Am I the only one who didn't know?

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:00.345
I was awful to him when we broke up,

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:01.972
so Hyeon-jun is very angry with me.

00:04:02.056 --> 00:04:04.767
I want to use this as an opportunity
to make up with him.

00:04:05.768 --> 00:04:07.019
You'll help me, right?

00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:24.036
In the story, Ju-ri and Hun-seok
meet through a dating app.

00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:26.663
Have you used one before?

00:04:27.998 --> 00:04:30.751
Do girls really meet guys
through dating apps?

00:04:30.834 --> 00:04:32.336
Isn't that what f****** losers do?

00:04:34.004 --> 00:04:35.464
I'm so f****** exhausted.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.050
Hey, can you pass me that?

00:04:47.017 --> 00:04:48.435
I'm sorry, everyone.

00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:50.896
I'm still hungover, you see.

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.439
Don't be mad at me!

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:03.700
I'm so f****** tired.

00:05:07.788 --> 00:05:08.997
I'm so sorry.

00:05:09.081 --> 00:05:11.041
I worked late last night
and didn't get any sleep.

00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:13.127
I'm sorry.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.294
Don't be mad at me!

00:05:16.171 --> 00:05:17.172
By the way,

00:05:17.256 --> 00:05:20.050
-can I get one of those too?
-What?

00:05:20.134 --> 00:05:21.677
This interview is so boring

00:05:22.261 --> 00:05:24.179
that I need one of those to wake up.

00:05:28.433 --> 00:05:30.144
I'm so sorry!

00:05:31.311 --> 00:05:32.563
Hey, hand me my phone.

00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:41.613
I'm glad that's off my chest.

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:45.075
You want to make up?

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:46.743
You and me?

00:05:47.786 --> 00:05:50.330
What made you even think of
being in this drama?

00:05:50.414 --> 00:05:51.999
I knew you'd never drop Kang Pil-gu.

00:05:52.082 --> 00:05:53.041
Then what about that movie?

00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:55.669
I turned it down after you did.

00:05:56.753 --> 00:05:58.463
Is that so? Yay for me!

00:05:58.547 --> 00:06:01.175
Then I'll drop Kang Pil-gu
and do that movie instead.

00:06:01.258 --> 00:06:03.010
Then I'll do that movie too.

00:06:05.137 --> 00:06:06.388
What are you up to?

00:06:06.972 --> 00:06:08.140
I told you.

00:06:08.223 --> 00:06:10.893
I still have feelings for you
and want to make up.

00:06:13.353 --> 00:06:14.771
Gwon Se-na, snap out of it.

00:06:14.855 --> 00:06:17.941
How can we possibly work together
on the same project?

00:06:18.817 --> 00:06:20.694
We can't possibly work together
on the same project.

00:06:21.278 --> 00:06:23.197
I really need this role.

00:06:24.156 --> 00:06:26.575
Do you want me to disappear entirely
from this industry?

00:06:29.161 --> 00:06:30.537
Yes.

00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:31.997
It'd be great if you disappeared.

00:06:33.123 --> 00:06:34.291
I was horrible, wasn't I?

00:06:34.374 --> 00:06:35.667
I was too young to know better.

00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:36.835
Don't make excuses.

00:06:37.836 --> 00:06:40.297
I was young too,
and I was desperate for that role.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.053
I don't want to apologize
or ask for your forgiveness.

00:06:46.136 --> 00:06:48.597
I stopped making
pathetic excuses like that ages ago,

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.932
so I can't even say it.

00:06:50.724 --> 00:06:53.185
Can't you just think of it this way?

00:06:54.186 --> 00:06:55.896
Let's pretend we're meeting
for the first time today.

00:06:56.772 --> 00:06:58.649
Like we're starting over again.

00:07:01.235 --> 00:07:02.986
Do I look like I have amnesia?

00:07:14.873 --> 00:07:16.124
Are you just now getting to work?

00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:19.378
I'm coming back from an interview.

00:07:20.337 --> 00:07:22.172
How's the job going?

00:07:23.632 --> 00:07:25.217
I'm trying to adjust.

00:07:26.802 --> 00:07:30.222
I hear you'll be covering
the baseball game tomorrow.

00:07:30.305 --> 00:07:31.556
The first pitch, I mean.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.600
Oh, yes.

00:07:34.101 --> 00:07:35.102
How about going together?

00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:37.646
Excuse me?

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:38.897
I'm sorry.

00:07:39.606 --> 00:07:41.316
Did that sound too flirty?

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.442
Not at all.

00:07:43.443 --> 00:07:44.611
I never said that.

00:07:44.695 --> 00:07:46.655
That's too bad,
because I meant to sound flirty.

00:07:53.578 --> 00:07:54.579
What are you doing?

00:07:54.663 --> 00:07:56.707
I want to be that thing you said.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:00.836
Someone who's decided
to be a good person, no matter what.

00:08:02.462 --> 00:08:04.923
Mr. Lee, you're a very good person.

00:08:05.007 --> 00:08:07.759
It's as if you decided
that you'd always be a good person to me,

00:08:07.843 --> 00:08:09.136
no matter what.

00:08:12.097 --> 00:08:15.058
Looking back on it,
I really liked what you said.

00:08:16.018 --> 00:08:19.313
So I really want to try
being that kind of person.

00:08:22.482 --> 00:08:25.736
If we happen to run into each other
at the baseball stadium tomorrow,

00:08:26.737 --> 00:08:29.239
wouldn't that be really nice?

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.241
Right, yes.

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:40.250
-Shall I call now?
-Yeah.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.463
-I'll see you tomorrow, then.
-Okay.

00:08:48.717 --> 00:08:50.635
-You're late.
-There was traffic.

00:08:50.719 --> 00:08:52.471
What were you and Mr. Lee talking about?

00:08:52.554 --> 00:08:53.764
He said he'd see you tomorrow.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.476
Do I have to answer that?

00:08:57.559 --> 00:08:59.394
Isn't that the purpose of a question?

00:09:00.479 --> 00:09:02.230
We were just…

00:09:02.814 --> 00:09:04.399
We were talking about some personal stuff.

00:09:18.538 --> 00:09:19.915
I asked around…

00:09:21.792 --> 00:09:23.293
and found out that Se-na turned down

00:09:23.377 --> 00:09:27.089
a bunch of movie offers
and took a huge pay cut to do Kang Pil-gu.

00:09:27.172 --> 00:09:30.342
Everyone's saying she must really want to
get back together with Hyeon-jun

00:09:30.425 --> 00:09:33.720
since there's no other reason
she would take a supporting role.

00:09:33.804 --> 00:09:36.264
-She says she still has feelings for me.
-What?

00:09:36.348 --> 00:09:38.975
-She wants to start over again.
-Seriously?

00:09:39.059 --> 00:09:41.395
It looks like she'll turn up
in every project I do.

00:09:41.478 --> 00:09:43.021
So what are you going to do?

00:09:45.148 --> 00:09:47.692
Now isn't the time to talk about that.

00:09:47.776 --> 00:09:49.569
Forget Gwon Se-na for now.

00:09:49.653 --> 00:09:51.363
Didn't we agree never to meet again

00:09:51.446 --> 00:09:53.782
as director and actor?

00:09:58.745 --> 00:10:01.873
I know what you're worried about, Mr. Lim.

00:10:01.957 --> 00:10:04.918
But things are different now.
I don't have much say in things anymore.

00:10:05.001 --> 00:10:09.047
And you said you didn't want to do it
because of Ms. Gwon, not me.

00:10:09.131 --> 00:10:10.757
I'm glad you brought that up.

00:10:10.841 --> 00:10:14.761
Then drop Ms. Gwon
before you approach me, Director.

00:10:14.845 --> 00:10:17.472
Why would I drop a global star like her?

00:10:18.098 --> 00:10:19.015
Then how about this?

00:10:20.058 --> 00:10:23.353
In the first episode,
I chase a suspect in a car

00:10:23.437 --> 00:10:25.147
and then get into a huge accident.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.483
So I undergo a face swap
and come out completely transformed.

00:10:28.567 --> 00:10:31.319
That way, another actor
can take over as Kang Pil-gu.

00:10:31.403 --> 00:10:32.446
Mr. Lim.

00:10:33.363 --> 00:10:35.782
I'll film up to that scene,
for old times' sake.

00:10:38.452 --> 00:10:40.537
I'm sorry to interrupt,

00:10:42.289 --> 00:10:45.584
but now's the time to play this.

00:10:47.669 --> 00:10:50.338
I, Lim Hyeon-jun, swear to perform

00:10:50.422 --> 00:10:51.756
-in season five of Kang Pil-gu,
-Damn you!

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.425
no matter what!

00:11:06.688 --> 00:11:09.399
"Right now, I think it's best
that you continue what you're doing

00:11:09.483 --> 00:11:13.028
rather than trying something new."
That's what the cards say.

00:11:13.111 --> 00:11:14.988
Let's pretend we're meeting
for the first time today.

00:11:15.071 --> 00:11:16.072
Like we're starting over again.

00:11:16.156 --> 00:11:21.036
I, Lim Hyeon-jun, swear to perform
in season five of Kang Pil-gu,

00:11:21.119 --> 00:11:22.037
no matter what!

00:11:43.767 --> 00:11:45.477
What was that?

00:11:46.603 --> 00:11:50.899
Why did my mind jump to that
for no reason?

00:11:50.982 --> 00:11:54.486
Did you think
I was one of the hostesses there?

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:06.790
I owe her an apology.

00:12:08.124 --> 00:12:10.085
It's really weighing me down.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:13.713
Bro, are you okay?

00:12:17.759 --> 00:12:19.052
-Mr. Hwang.
-Yeah?

00:12:19.678 --> 00:12:21.388
Can you go and apologize
to someone for me?

00:12:21.471 --> 00:12:23.390
Bro, apologies
and caring for your folks are on you.

00:12:32.023 --> 00:12:35.527
I guess this season will be a megahit
if Gwon Se-na is in it.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.574
-That goes without saying.
-Mr. Hwang.

00:12:41.449 --> 00:12:43.118
I'm being serious right now.

00:12:43.201 --> 00:12:45.412
If you tell me to do Kang Pil-gu
one more time,

00:12:45.495 --> 00:12:46.997
I'll find a different agency.

00:12:48.623 --> 00:12:50.959
This is the last time, and I mean it.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.378
Wait, you'll do it?

00:12:55.046 --> 00:12:57.299
-Bro, you'll really do it?
-Yeah.

00:12:57.382 --> 00:12:59.467
You sure you're okay
working with Gwon Se-na?

00:12:59.551 --> 00:13:00.802
Of course, I'm not okay.

00:13:01.386 --> 00:13:03.013
But I will be,

00:13:03.096 --> 00:13:04.764
because I'm a better person than her.

00:13:04.848 --> 00:13:06.433
Good call, bro!

00:13:06.516 --> 00:13:08.852
I don't care
if she still has feelings for me.

00:13:09.436 --> 00:13:10.520
I'm going to focus on my work.

00:13:10.604 --> 00:13:13.064
-I like the serious act.
-It's not an act.

00:13:15.942 --> 00:13:17.611
That said,

00:13:18.194 --> 00:13:19.863
I have a few conditions.

00:13:19.946 --> 00:13:21.323
Conditions?

00:13:21.406 --> 00:13:22.699
-First.
-First.

00:13:23.283 --> 00:13:26.745
There will be no romantic storyline
with Gwon Se-na.

00:13:26.828 --> 00:13:28.496
No physical intimacy whatsoever.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:29.414
Second.

00:13:31.041 --> 00:13:34.544
Only five scenes
with Gwon Se-na per episode.

00:13:34.628 --> 00:13:36.463
No more than that.

00:13:37.047 --> 00:13:37.881
Third.

00:13:37.964 --> 00:13:39.299
The second unit will start the shoot,

00:13:39.382 --> 00:13:43.303
and I'll only work with its director,
not with Director Bak Byeong-gi.

00:13:43.803 --> 00:13:44.638
Fourth.

00:13:44.721 --> 00:13:48.808
After this season, Lim Hyeon-jun
will no longer appear in Kang Pil-gu.

00:13:51.353 --> 00:13:52.312
Go ahead and drink it.

00:13:52.896 --> 00:13:54.606
You've always wanted to try it.

00:14:01.529 --> 00:14:03.156
Those are my conditions.

00:14:03.239 --> 00:14:05.116
If you agree to these conditions,

00:14:05.825 --> 00:14:08.078
-he says he'll do it.
-What if we don't?

00:14:08.161 --> 00:14:10.330
If you don't agree to them,
then he won't do it.

00:14:10.413 --> 00:14:13.083
How about we agree for now
and change our tune later?

00:14:13.166 --> 00:14:14.709
-Right!
-Right.

00:14:14.793 --> 00:14:16.419
If you change your tune,
then he won't do it.

00:14:18.463 --> 00:14:19.631
They agreed to the conditions?

00:14:19.714 --> 00:14:20.757
All of them?

00:14:22.467 --> 00:14:23.301
What did Byeong-gi say?

00:14:23.385 --> 00:14:26.262
Mr. Bak… I guess he's Director Bak now.

00:14:26.346 --> 00:14:28.306
Anyway, he agreed to everything.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:30.892
You know he's not
the two-faced type, right?

00:14:30.975 --> 00:14:32.769
I think we can trust him.

00:14:32.852 --> 00:14:34.062
He's changed a lot.

00:14:34.145 --> 00:14:37.691
He's not the same
indie-film-making fanatic anymore.

00:14:37.774 --> 00:14:39.734
He takes one-on-one Pilates lessons

00:14:39.818 --> 00:14:42.904
and sips 20,000-won coffee
while having brunch.

00:14:42.987 --> 00:14:45.281
He's not the same Bak Byeong-gi
from back in the day.

00:14:45.365 --> 00:14:48.076
Bro, you own a supercar
worth hundreds of millions of won,

00:14:48.159 --> 00:14:50.078
while bossing around
the director and production company.

00:14:50.161 --> 00:14:53.540
And you eat salad with chicken breast
instead of just fried chicken.

00:14:54.082 --> 00:14:55.792
Do you think you're still the same?

00:14:55.875 --> 00:14:57.711
Fine, whatever.

00:14:57.794 --> 00:15:02.424
Oh, and about that blind date
with no celebrities or reporters…

00:15:02.507 --> 00:15:06.428
I know someone who's really great.
Should I go ahead and set it up?

00:15:06.511 --> 00:15:07.512
A blind date?

00:15:08.388 --> 00:15:11.599
Sure, maybe after all this is over.

00:15:11.683 --> 00:15:13.143
Jeez, you were begging not too long ago.

00:15:13.226 --> 00:15:15.145
Anyway, I'll see you
at the baseball stadium later.

00:15:15.228 --> 00:15:17.063
Hey, hold on.

00:15:17.147 --> 00:15:20.900
They'll probably send a sports reporter
for today's first pitch event, right?

00:15:20.984 --> 00:15:23.695
Hey, bro, I'm getting a call right now.

00:15:23.778 --> 00:15:25.405
See you later!

00:15:38.585 --> 00:15:39.419
You're going on a blind date?

00:15:39.502 --> 00:15:41.129
Man, you scared me.

00:15:43.089 --> 00:15:44.174
Yeah, so what?

00:15:44.257 --> 00:15:46.176
I really liked that reporter.

00:15:46.718 --> 00:15:50.013
If you like her that much,
you should go out with her instead.

00:15:50.096 --> 00:15:52.015
Have you even seen her before?

00:15:52.098 --> 00:15:53.767
I met her when I went to Hong-sin's place.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:56.311
She seemed really cool
and passionate about her job.

00:15:57.437 --> 00:15:58.730
Are you still hanging out with him?

00:15:58.813 --> 00:16:01.232
Do I need your permission
to see friends at my age?

00:16:04.652 --> 00:16:05.570
And Hyeon-jun.

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:07.906
I'm saying this because I care about you,

00:16:07.989 --> 00:16:09.699
but you need to meet someone

00:16:09.783 --> 00:16:12.076
who likes you for who you are,
not because you're an actor.

00:16:15.955 --> 00:16:18.625
Not that you'd find someone like that
with your sense of judgment.

00:16:21.252 --> 00:16:24.172
What's wrong with my sense of judgment?

00:16:35.809 --> 00:16:37.227
Wow, there are so many people here.

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.229
Wind it up and pitch!

00:16:39.312 --> 00:16:40.647
Why are you so excited?

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.232
Why wouldn't I be excited?

00:16:42.315 --> 00:16:44.400
I never come because I'm so busy
waiting on you hand and foot.

00:16:44.484 --> 00:16:46.736
Hand and foot?
Stop talking like I'm some mother-in-law.

00:16:47.278 --> 00:16:48.905
You're worse than that.

00:16:49.656 --> 00:16:51.950
Can I go and get player autographs later?

00:16:52.033 --> 00:16:53.451
Fine, go ahead.

00:16:53.535 --> 00:16:54.369
But come right back.

00:16:54.452 --> 00:16:56.204
-All right.
-It's awkward being alone.

00:16:56.287 --> 00:16:57.205
Let's hurry along.

00:17:00.333 --> 00:17:02.961
RESTRICTED AREA
COACHING STAFF ONLY

00:17:04.003 --> 00:17:05.547
I look forward to today's game.

00:17:06.172 --> 00:17:07.674
-Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

00:17:08.174 --> 00:17:09.551
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

00:17:10.552 --> 00:17:11.511
Jeez!

00:17:11.594 --> 00:17:14.430
Man, why am I pitching worse?

00:17:15.348 --> 00:17:16.558
Darn it.

00:17:26.442 --> 00:17:27.277
You're in great form.

00:17:29.737 --> 00:17:32.073
-What?
-You must've played baseball before.

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.244
-Let's get into pitching form.
-Okay.

00:17:36.327 --> 00:17:37.495
-Start your windup.
-Okay.

00:17:38.913 --> 00:17:40.832
-Now stop.
-Stop?

00:17:40.915 --> 00:17:43.459
The important thing is
to keep your back foot planted.

00:17:43.543 --> 00:17:45.503
-Engage your glutes to hold position.
-Okay.

00:17:45.587 --> 00:17:47.130
Use your glutes to stay balanced.

00:17:47.213 --> 00:17:49.132
As you move forward,

00:17:49.215 --> 00:17:50.466
-extend your front hand,
-Okay.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:51.843
and then throw with your back hand.

00:17:51.926 --> 00:17:53.845
-Right.
-But don't throw with your arm.

00:17:53.928 --> 00:17:56.472
Use your body rotation to throw the ball.

00:17:56.556 --> 00:17:58.433
-Should I give it a try?
-Yes, go ahead.

00:17:58.516 --> 00:17:59.392
All right.

00:18:01.978 --> 00:18:03.646
-Nicely done.
-Wow, that felt different.

00:18:06.524 --> 00:18:07.483
Are you a baseball player?

00:18:08.818 --> 00:18:10.236
I was, a long time ago.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.654
Hold on…

00:18:13.698 --> 00:18:16.743
Have we met before? You look familiar.

00:18:16.826 --> 00:18:20.288
I just have one of those faces.

00:18:25.793 --> 00:18:28.004
-Why don't you throw again?
-Okay.

00:18:37.096 --> 00:18:37.972
Ms. Wi!

00:18:38.056 --> 00:18:39.807
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:18:39.891 --> 00:18:41.643
You must be doing the interview today.

00:18:41.726 --> 00:18:43.061
Yes, that's right.

00:18:43.144 --> 00:18:44.687
I got lost because the stadium is so big.

00:18:44.771 --> 00:18:47.690
Mr. Lim is practicing
his first pitch right now.

00:18:48.191 --> 00:18:49.484
-Really?
-Come with me.

00:18:49.567 --> 00:18:50.944
-Shall I?
-Yes, come on.

00:19:00.244 --> 00:19:02.038
Wow, very nice.

00:19:03.206 --> 00:19:04.707
You're a very fast learner.

00:19:04.791 --> 00:19:07.919
I wish it had landed
more in the strike zone.

00:19:08.002 --> 00:19:09.128
Mr. Lim.

00:19:14.384 --> 00:19:15.885
You're Lee Jae-hyeong, aren't you?

00:19:15.969 --> 00:19:18.513
This is amazing. Can I shake your hand?

00:19:20.014 --> 00:19:20.974
You took me by surprise.

00:19:21.557 --> 00:19:23.393
Ms. Wi, you're finally here.

00:19:23.476 --> 00:19:24.978
So you really did come.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.105
Of course.

00:19:27.188 --> 00:19:30.024
Remember how I said
we might happen to run into each other?

00:19:31.401 --> 00:19:34.195
Bro, how come you're getting coached
by Mr. Lee Jae-hyeong?

00:19:34.779 --> 00:19:35.947
What an honor.

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:38.783
Who knew I'd get to see
Lee Jae-hyeong in real life?

00:19:42.203 --> 00:19:43.663
Don't you know who he is?

00:19:43.746 --> 00:19:45.081
Holy cow.

00:19:45.164 --> 00:19:47.291
He played in the majors
for the New York Hartz!

00:19:47.375 --> 00:19:48.793
Oh, come on.

00:19:48.876 --> 00:19:50.586
Of course, I know who he is!

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:53.506
How could I not know Mr. Lee Jae-hyeong?

00:19:56.676 --> 00:19:58.511
Well, I'm just a corporate worker now.

00:19:58.594 --> 00:20:01.014
My goodness, just a coporate worker?

00:20:01.097 --> 00:20:03.433
You're the president of Sports Eunseong.

00:20:03.516 --> 00:20:05.727
-Right, Ms. Wi?
-Yes.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.520
I'm just here for the game today.

00:20:08.271 --> 00:20:10.189
Ms. Wi, you said it's your first time
at a baseball stadium, right?

00:20:10.648 --> 00:20:11.482
Yes.

00:20:11.566 --> 00:20:14.152
Then let's watch together
after the interview.

00:20:14.235 --> 00:20:17.447
These stadiums seem huge,
but you can actually see things up close.

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:20.116
You can even see
the players' faces clearly.

00:20:20.199 --> 00:20:21.117
Shall we, then?

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.370
If my team wins today,

00:20:24.454 --> 00:20:25.580
I'll buy you dinner.

00:20:27.248 --> 00:20:28.124
Okay.

00:20:35.465 --> 00:20:36.841
Is this your first time
throwing the first pitch?

00:20:38.468 --> 00:20:39.302
Yes.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:53.191
You must be happy to throw the first pitch
for your favorite team.

00:20:57.195 --> 00:20:58.029
Yes.

00:21:12.668 --> 00:21:14.170
What's your mindset going into today?

00:21:15.296 --> 00:21:16.255
"Do your best."

00:21:18.883 --> 00:21:19.842
"Just do your best."

00:21:20.676 --> 00:21:22.595
-Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun.
-Yes?

00:21:22.678 --> 00:21:25.515
How am I supposed to write the article

00:21:25.598 --> 00:21:27.350
if you only give me short answers?

00:21:32.855 --> 00:21:34.023
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:41.364
That's it for the interview.

00:21:42.406 --> 00:21:43.491
What?

00:21:43.574 --> 00:21:46.619
You told me to figure it out
with your short answers, so I will.

00:21:46.702 --> 00:21:49.664
You know that's not what I meant.

00:21:49.747 --> 00:21:50.581
-I…
-Ms. Wi.

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:53.835
-Are you done with the interview?
-Yes, I am.

00:21:54.418 --> 00:21:55.419
Wait, I…

00:21:55.503 --> 00:21:57.630
Let's go now, then.
The game's about to start.

00:21:57.713 --> 00:22:00.383
Excuse me, Ms. Wi?

00:22:00.466 --> 00:22:02.927
Good luck with your first pitch, Mr. Lim.
You've got this!

00:22:03.845 --> 00:22:04.679
I've got this.

00:22:08.224 --> 00:22:09.433
Hey, bro.

00:22:10.893 --> 00:22:13.479
We're watching the game
after the first pitch, right?

00:22:14.355 --> 00:22:16.524
Come on, they gave us VIP seats!

00:22:16.607 --> 00:22:19.569
When's the next time
I'll be able to watch a game from there?

00:22:20.153 --> 00:22:23.072
Right, Ms. Wi and Mr. Lee
will be there too.

00:22:23.156 --> 00:22:24.282
I've got to get his autograph.

00:22:24.365 --> 00:22:27.076
An autograph? Seriously, act your age.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.328
Why are you in a bad mood? What happened?

00:22:29.871 --> 00:22:31.038
Can I get an autograph?

00:22:31.622 --> 00:22:32.623
What a pretty name.

00:22:35.126 --> 00:22:36.335
No, but really,

00:22:36.419 --> 00:22:39.589
my daughter is a huge fan
of Mr. Lee Jae-hyeong.

00:22:39.672 --> 00:22:41.632
You retired too early.

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.052
Jeez.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:49.056
I wondered where I'd seen him before.

00:22:51.851 --> 00:22:53.895
So you used to be a baseball player?

00:22:57.398 --> 00:23:00.359
I played in the pros for a bit.

00:23:02.528 --> 00:23:04.113
I was pretty famous, you know.

00:23:04.697 --> 00:23:06.240
Could you show some more interest?

00:23:12.246 --> 00:23:14.123
What should we have for dinner later?

00:23:14.957 --> 00:23:16.167
What do you like, Ms. Wi?

00:23:17.043 --> 00:23:19.503
Didn't you say you'd buy dinner
if your team wins?

00:23:19.587 --> 00:23:20.922
I'm rooting for both teams.

00:23:23.174 --> 00:23:24.467
One of them will win.

00:23:27.845 --> 00:23:29.347
-Dig in, please.
-All right.

00:23:38.356 --> 00:23:39.398
Bro, you okay?

00:23:41.442 --> 00:23:42.902
-What?
-Are you okay?

00:23:42.985 --> 00:23:44.111
Yeah.

00:23:46.572 --> 00:23:49.408
Now, the star
of Good Detective Kang Pil-gu,

00:23:49.492 --> 00:23:51.827
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun,
will throw the first pitch!

00:23:55.414 --> 00:23:57.959
LIM HYEON-JUN
TODAY'S FIRST PITCH GUEST

00:24:09.428 --> 00:24:10.638
Hello, everyone!

00:24:10.721 --> 00:24:13.516
I'm Lim Hyeon-jun,
the actor who plays Kang Pil-gu

00:24:13.599 --> 00:24:14.976
in Good Detective Kang Pil-gu!

00:24:15.559 --> 00:24:16.519
Thank you!

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:31.784
He nailed that throw.

00:24:34.328 --> 00:24:36.205
It was worth giving him a crash course.

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.108
What's wrong? Do you feel ill?

00:25:04.984 --> 00:25:06.277
No, I'm okay.

00:25:17.455 --> 00:25:18.581
BAHN SOO-JUNG

00:25:20.207 --> 00:25:21.250
Mr. Lee.

00:25:21.334 --> 00:25:22.543
I'm sorry,

00:25:23.336 --> 00:25:25.588
but I won't make it to dinner tonight.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.799
But…

00:25:37.725 --> 00:25:39.685
I'm sorry for calling you so suddenly.

00:25:40.478 --> 00:25:41.520
It's okay.

00:25:43.147 --> 00:25:46.567
But you don't look so well.

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:47.735
I haven't been able to sleep.

00:25:49.653 --> 00:25:52.239
Soo-jung, is there something
you're hiding from me?

00:25:54.533 --> 00:25:55.868
Ms. Wi.

00:25:55.951 --> 00:25:58.079
Can you pretend you never saw

00:25:58.162 --> 00:26:00.414
the video I handed over to you?

00:26:00.498 --> 00:26:03.167
And forget you ever heard
Gwon Se-na's name.

00:26:03.709 --> 00:26:05.378
Why? What's going on?

00:26:13.135 --> 00:26:14.095
The truth is,

00:26:15.471 --> 00:26:17.390
another hostess who was there that night…

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.811
asked that man for money.

00:26:22.395 --> 00:26:26.607
She thought he and Gwon Se-na were dating,

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:29.026
so she said she'd expose them
if he didn't pay.

00:26:30.027 --> 00:26:31.779
But he gave her a huge amount.

00:26:31.862 --> 00:26:34.698
She was so scared
that she promised to return the money

00:26:34.782 --> 00:26:36.534
and not to expose them.

00:26:36.617 --> 00:26:40.579
But he said you can't undo
what's been done,

00:26:40.663 --> 00:26:44.458
and that if word gets out,
he'd come after her.

00:26:44.542 --> 00:26:47.586
I haven't been able
to reach her since then.

00:26:48.587 --> 00:26:49.422
Ms. Wi.

00:26:51.173 --> 00:26:53.884
That man is seriously dangerous, isn't he?

00:26:56.679 --> 00:26:57.888
If you want this to end,

00:26:58.722 --> 00:27:01.434
you have to tell me the truth
about everything.

00:27:02.184 --> 00:27:05.312
Everything about that man,
and about Gwon Se-na as well.

00:27:13.696 --> 00:27:18.367
When you were at the Geumsang Arts Awards…

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.244
That night,

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.247
the chairman you asked questions to…

00:27:24.748 --> 00:27:26.000
It was him.

00:27:27.585 --> 00:27:29.879
That's the man who dated Ms. Gwon Se-na.

00:27:53.569 --> 00:27:55.029
EUNSEONGILBO'S CHAIRMAN LEE DAE-HO
AT THE GEUMSANG ARTS AWARDS

00:28:26.727 --> 00:28:28.812
LEE DAE-HO

00:28:30.773 --> 00:28:31.941
LEE DAE-HO
EUNSEONG GROUP (CHAIRMAN)

00:28:33.901 --> 00:28:36.779
YOUNGER BROTHER
LEE JAE-HYEONG

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:40.491
I recently joined Sports Eunseong
as the new president.

00:28:40.574 --> 00:28:41.408
Do you run a conglomerate?

00:28:41.992 --> 00:28:43.452
My brother's the one who runs it.

00:28:43.953 --> 00:28:46.288
I'm just a salaried president.

00:28:56.966 --> 00:29:00.094
So the passcode's the same
as your last place.

00:29:09.019 --> 00:29:10.187
How did you find this place?

00:29:10.271 --> 00:29:11.772
Why pretend to live modestly

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:14.316
when you can be in a mansion?

00:29:16.443 --> 00:29:17.278
Get out.

00:29:17.361 --> 00:29:20.864
Barging into your ex's place like this
is considered trespassing.

00:29:23.492 --> 00:29:24.827
Did we break up?

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:26.036
Why? When?

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.454
What are you up to?

00:29:28.038 --> 00:29:29.873
If you don't want to break up with me,

00:29:29.957 --> 00:29:31.417
then get a divorce.

00:29:31.917 --> 00:29:33.002
Hey, Gwon Se-na.

00:29:37.548 --> 00:29:38.382
Listen carefully.

00:29:38.465 --> 00:29:40.551
You're not stupid,
so I won't repeat myself.

00:29:41.176 --> 00:29:44.847
We're an economic community.
You know what that is, right?

00:29:45.431 --> 00:29:46.640
That means you and I

00:29:46.724 --> 00:29:50.269
can't break up that easily, okay?

00:29:58.819 --> 00:30:02.448
I was worried you'd have a panic attack.
I'm glad you didn't.

00:30:03.282 --> 00:30:06.660
Look, I'm stronger than you think.

00:30:07.286 --> 00:30:08.412
Right.

00:30:09.079 --> 00:30:10.205
By the way,

00:30:10.289 --> 00:30:13.167
why did Ms. Wi take off
without watching the game?

00:30:14.376 --> 00:30:15.961
You have Ms. Wi's number, right?

00:30:16.045 --> 00:30:18.005
Yeah, I think I got her business card.

00:30:18.088 --> 00:30:18.964
Give it to me.

00:30:19.757 --> 00:30:20.841
Why?

00:30:20.924 --> 00:30:22.343
Because the interview went badly?

00:30:22.926 --> 00:30:26.388
No, it's because
I said something I shouldn't have.

00:30:27.014 --> 00:30:28.432
What did you say?

00:30:28.515 --> 00:30:31.352
Did you think
I was one of the hostesses there?

00:30:31.435 --> 00:30:32.394
Jeez.

00:30:32.478 --> 00:30:34.647
Are you saying you were dressed like that

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:37.983
to do some undercover reporting
or something like that?

00:30:40.653 --> 00:30:42.279
What if I was?

00:30:43.364 --> 00:30:44.865
Bro, have you lost your mind?

00:30:44.948 --> 00:30:47.743
Even if you had suspicions,
you should've kept them to yourself.

00:30:47.826 --> 00:30:50.287
Why would you say that to her face?

00:30:51.538 --> 00:30:52.456
Do you think

00:30:53.916 --> 00:30:54.875
she got really offended?

00:30:55.459 --> 00:30:57.294
Totally.

00:30:58.087 --> 00:31:00.172
I would've sued you immediately.

00:31:00.255 --> 00:31:01.131
Come on.

00:31:02.257 --> 00:31:03.217
Was it that bad?

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:05.135
Totally.

00:31:11.892 --> 00:31:15.813
Jeez, I'll lose face if I call her first.

00:31:17.773 --> 00:31:18.732
All right.

00:31:19.483 --> 00:31:21.068
I'll save her number first.

00:31:22.069 --> 00:31:23.320
Wait a minute.

00:31:23.404 --> 00:31:26.365
If I save her number,
she'll see my name when I message her.

00:31:27.282 --> 00:31:28.242
Darn it.

00:31:30.119 --> 00:31:31.120
Goodness.

00:31:31.203 --> 00:31:32.913
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:31:32.996 --> 00:31:34.331
I saw you throw the first pitch.

00:31:35.165 --> 00:31:36.333
You looked amazing.

00:31:36.417 --> 00:31:37.418
-Thank you.
-By the way,

00:31:37.501 --> 00:31:40.337
I heard your mother is
actress Seong Ae-suk.

00:31:40.421 --> 00:31:43.173
You must've gotten
your acting genes from her.

00:31:47.511 --> 00:31:49.847
-Please go ahead. I have a call to make.
-Come on.

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:51.390
-Let's go up together.
-No, it's okay.

00:31:52.266 --> 00:31:53.100
Go ahead.

00:31:59.398 --> 00:32:01.775
-It says your mother is Seong Ae-suk,
-Did you plan on revealing that your…

00:32:01.859 --> 00:32:03.152
Do you still keep in touch with Ms. Seong?

00:32:03.235 --> 00:32:05.529
How long have you known
that Ms. Seong was in erotic films?

00:32:06.905 --> 00:32:07.740
Why did you hide this?

00:32:07.823 --> 00:32:09.783
If I hadn't given birth to you back then,

00:32:09.867 --> 00:32:13.829
I could've escaped my sexy public image,
and my career would've taken off!

00:32:23.881 --> 00:32:25.716
So you had another panic attack?

00:32:25.799 --> 00:32:26.633
Yes.

00:32:27.885 --> 00:32:31.889
I'm always aware of my anxiety
when I have to be around a lot of people.

00:32:32.473 --> 00:32:35.392
But I had an attack near the elevator
in my apartment building.

00:32:35.476 --> 00:32:36.977
What kind of situation was it?

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.855
I was with some neighbors I usually greet.

00:32:39.938 --> 00:32:42.775
They said something that bothered me,

00:32:42.858 --> 00:32:46.278
and the second I heard it,
I couldn't breathe all of a sudden.

00:32:46.361 --> 00:32:48.530
I knew I was having another panic attack.

00:32:52.659 --> 00:32:53.619
Right, so…

00:32:54.953 --> 00:32:56.246
Should I just wrap it up again?

00:32:57.289 --> 00:32:59.666
There's no one in the waiting room today,
so you can keep going.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:00.709
I see.

00:33:02.544 --> 00:33:04.129
I've been very curious about this.

00:33:04.213 --> 00:33:06.340
How on earth did I get a panic disorder?

00:33:06.423 --> 00:33:08.091
I just can't understand it.

00:33:08.175 --> 00:33:09.092
In what way?

00:33:10.761 --> 00:33:14.097
My career was once ruined
because of a woman,

00:33:14.181 --> 00:33:15.682
my mom got into money trouble,

00:33:15.766 --> 00:33:18.143
and I had to make money
for my brother's tuition.

00:33:18.227 --> 00:33:20.813
Even though I'd stay up all night
binding books at the print shop,

00:33:20.896 --> 00:33:22.314
I was totally fine.

00:33:22.397 --> 00:33:24.483
I'm in a much better place now
than I was back then.

00:33:24.566 --> 00:33:28.237
I can have or do whatever I want,
and I'm living a life anyone would envy.

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.864
So how can I get a panic disorder
over something so petty?

00:33:30.948 --> 00:33:32.533
If someone like me gets a panic order,

00:33:32.616 --> 00:33:35.786
then wouldn't nine out of ten people
in this country have it as well?

00:33:35.869 --> 00:33:39.164
It's common for panic to set in
once people return from battle,

00:33:39.248 --> 00:33:41.041
rather than during the actual battle.

00:33:43.544 --> 00:33:46.463
Then what else can I do
to make myself better

00:33:46.547 --> 00:33:48.131
other than taking meds?

00:33:48.215 --> 00:33:49.633
Sleep well and eat well.

00:33:49.716 --> 00:33:52.803
And avoid drinking
alcohol and coffee for now.

00:33:52.886 --> 00:33:54.346
And when it comes to mental health,

00:33:54.429 --> 00:33:57.140
it helps to have positive relationships.

00:33:58.475 --> 00:33:59.434
Then…

00:34:01.812 --> 00:34:03.647
By any chance,

00:34:04.481 --> 00:34:06.108
do you think dating…

00:34:07.734 --> 00:34:08.944
could be helpful?

00:34:11.446 --> 00:34:13.740
Of course, meeting the right person
can definitely help.

00:34:13.824 --> 00:34:17.077
But don't expect your panic to get better
just because someone cares for you.

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:19.580
Love is better when it's reciprocated.

00:34:19.663 --> 00:34:22.457
It's the same as hyperventilating
if you think about it.

00:34:22.541 --> 00:34:26.128
People think that breathing a lot
will make the suffocating feeling go away.

00:34:26.211 --> 00:34:28.672
Similarly, people think
that building a bond with someone

00:34:28.755 --> 00:34:32.593
and feeling loved and cared for
will make things better.

00:34:32.676 --> 00:34:34.094
But that's not true.

00:34:34.761 --> 00:34:35.929
Inhale.

00:34:37.556 --> 00:34:38.724
And exhale.

00:34:40.684 --> 00:34:42.394
Just as we breathe in and out,

00:34:42.477 --> 00:34:45.731
love has to be both given and received.

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:56.617
Hello.

00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:59.828
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

00:34:59.912 --> 00:35:01.079
Nice to meet you too.

00:35:01.997 --> 00:35:04.291
Mr. Lim, what's your MBTI type?

00:35:05.918 --> 00:35:07.419
My MBTI type?

00:35:08.086 --> 00:35:10.714
Well, I'm INFJ--

00:35:10.797 --> 00:35:12.674
No, you're INTP.

00:35:13.675 --> 00:35:14.509
Is that so?

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:16.637
You know better than I do.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:20.766
You're naturally very energetic
and can't stand injustice.

00:35:20.849 --> 00:35:24.186
So I thought you were an extrovert,
but you're the total opposite.

00:35:24.269 --> 00:35:25.729
I see.

00:35:26.229 --> 00:35:30.525
Well, that's because Kang Pil-gu
is just a character I play.

00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:32.361
Where do you live, Mr. Lim?

00:35:32.444 --> 00:35:34.696
Oh, I live--

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:37.699
I saw online
that you live in the Hannam Dia.

00:35:38.283 --> 00:35:40.035
Isn't that place super expensive?

00:35:42.621 --> 00:35:43.997
That information shows up online?

00:35:44.081 --> 00:35:45.666
Yes, of course.

00:35:46.917 --> 00:35:49.294
Have you met Byeon Woo-seok?
How about Cha Eun-woo?

00:35:49.378 --> 00:35:51.296
I bet they're so handsome in person.

00:35:52.381 --> 00:35:54.466
Yes, of course.

00:35:55.092 --> 00:35:55.926
Right.

00:35:56.009 --> 00:35:58.095
Are you really Lim Hyeon-jun?

00:35:58.679 --> 00:36:00.931
I'm such a huge fan!

00:36:01.014 --> 00:36:03.934
I watched every season of Kang Pil-gu.

00:36:04.017 --> 00:36:05.102
-Thank you--
-Snap!

00:36:05.185 --> 00:36:06.603
"They say you can't fix people."

00:36:06.687 --> 00:36:07.813
"But I do."

00:36:07.896 --> 00:36:09.022
That's the line, right?

00:36:09.898 --> 00:36:10.857
Yes, right.

00:36:12.985 --> 00:36:15.404
Gosh, it feels like
I should give you an autograph.

00:36:15.487 --> 00:36:17.447
Yes, please. And I want a photo.

00:36:17.531 --> 00:36:19.908
I can post it on my social media, right?
Thanks!

00:36:19.992 --> 00:36:21.201
Hold on, I…

00:36:21.284 --> 00:36:22.202
Smile!

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:33.380
Mr. Lim, did you get home safely?

00:36:33.463 --> 00:36:37.175
It was a real pleasure and honor
to meet you today.

00:36:39.177 --> 00:36:40.762
Honor, my ass.

00:36:43.557 --> 00:36:44.808
Hyeon-jun, are you home?

00:36:47.227 --> 00:36:50.647
Hey, how do kids these days
meet people to date?

00:36:50.731 --> 00:36:51.732
Why do you ask?

00:36:53.066 --> 00:36:55.610
My friends use dating apps.

00:36:57.237 --> 00:36:58.321
Dating apps?

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:01.158
What's the world coming to?

00:37:01.241 --> 00:37:04.411
It won't be long
before AI takes over the world.

00:37:04.494 --> 00:37:06.496
You're one to talk.
Su-ji is your best friend.

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:09.624
And people used to meet as pen pals
and then get married.

00:37:09.708 --> 00:37:12.210
Focus on your studies
instead of lecturing me, you punk.

00:37:13.045 --> 00:37:13.879
Jeez.

00:37:15.422 --> 00:37:17.841
By the way, what's in those boxes?

00:37:19.551 --> 00:37:21.511
Those are the rice cookers that I promote.

00:37:21.595 --> 00:37:24.056
The advertiser sent them as a gift,
but I have no one to give them to.

00:37:25.015 --> 00:37:26.349
They look expensive.

00:37:26.933 --> 00:37:28.185
Can I sell them on Onion?

00:37:29.227 --> 00:37:30.228
Onion?

00:37:31.021 --> 00:37:32.522
Oh, that secondhand platform?

00:37:33.356 --> 00:37:35.233
-Do whatever you want.
-Awesome.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.195
Oh, right.

00:37:38.278 --> 00:37:41.073
-My account got suspended.
-Why?

00:37:41.156 --> 00:37:43.700
I sold a few of the down jackets
you received as gifts,

00:37:43.784 --> 00:37:45.660
and someone reported me
as a commercial seller.

00:37:46.661 --> 00:37:48.747
Oh, boy.

00:37:49.247 --> 00:37:50.332
Let me borrow your phone.

00:37:52.793 --> 00:37:55.378
Hey, how do you know my passcode?

00:37:56.463 --> 00:37:57.672
It's my birthday.

00:38:02.219 --> 00:38:03.595
ENTER NICKNAME: KANG PIL-GU
NICKNAME TAKEN

00:38:03.678 --> 00:38:04.971
Why are there so many Kang Pil-gus?

00:38:05.055 --> 00:38:06.306
What are you doing?

00:38:06.389 --> 00:38:09.309
I downloaded the Onion app,
but there are too many Kang Pil-gus.

00:38:09.392 --> 00:38:10.352
This won't do.

00:38:12.646 --> 00:38:16.233
How much of my stuff did you sell
for your account to get suspended?

00:38:19.653 --> 00:38:20.487
Hey!

00:38:20.987 --> 00:38:23.532
What are you doing with my phone?

00:38:31.414 --> 00:38:33.667
Of course, meeting the right person
can definitely help.

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:40.048
You need to meet someone

00:38:40.132 --> 00:38:41.967
who likes you for who you are,
not because you're an actor.

00:38:47.389 --> 00:38:48.348
Onion!

00:38:57.315 --> 00:38:58.775
What, already?

00:38:58.859 --> 00:39:01.903
Hello, do you still have the rice cooker?

00:39:01.987 --> 00:39:03.613
Of course, I do.

00:39:04.239 --> 00:39:07.659
-Yes, I do.
-Can you give me a 30,000 won discount?

00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:09.452
Thirty thousand won?

00:39:10.912 --> 00:39:13.540
Sure, do whatever you want.

00:39:13.623 --> 00:39:14.833
Yes, I can do that.

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.255
That punk set my nickname as "Melomaster."

00:39:20.338 --> 00:39:21.173
SOULISHERE, MELOMASTER

00:39:27.053 --> 00:39:28.263
Melomaster…

00:39:28.763 --> 00:39:32.058
Can I get a veggie sandwich
on Parmesan oregano bread

00:39:32.142 --> 00:39:35.145
with lettuce, tomato, cucumber,
bell peppers, and onion?

00:39:35.228 --> 00:39:37.981
And the sauce… Can you recommend one?

00:39:38.064 --> 00:39:39.316
-Sure thing.
-Thank you.

00:39:45.906 --> 00:39:48.366
Wow, I went with your suggestion,
and it tastes great!

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:51.119
See? I eat this all the time
when I'm on a diet.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:55.207
By the way, how did the blind dates go?

00:39:55.916 --> 00:39:57.459
They were okay, I guess.

00:39:57.542 --> 00:39:59.377
What's wrong? You didn't like any of them?

00:40:00.253 --> 00:40:02.631
No, it just felt like

00:40:03.423 --> 00:40:05.842
I was holding one-on-one fan meetings.

00:40:06.927 --> 00:40:08.428
This is all your fault!

00:40:08.511 --> 00:40:11.640
I need to be in rom-coms or melodramas
if I want a dating life!

00:40:12.849 --> 00:40:15.227
Why do you always blame me for everything?

00:40:15.769 --> 00:40:17.187
Seriously. Oh, right.

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:19.439
The article about you doing Kang Pil-gu
is going out today.

00:40:19.522 --> 00:40:21.942
-That's okay, right?
-Yeah.

00:40:22.025 --> 00:40:24.069
I'm meeting the chief of Sports Eunseong
and Ms. Wi.

00:40:24.152 --> 00:40:25.070
Are you coming?

00:40:25.654 --> 00:40:26.905
Do I have to be there?

00:40:26.988 --> 00:40:29.157
I guess you're busy
with the commercial shoot.

00:40:30.325 --> 00:40:34.037
Did you think
I was one of the hostesses there?

00:40:34.621 --> 00:40:35.538
Actually, no.

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:38.917
I'll make some time.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.502
Okay, then.

00:40:59.437 --> 00:41:00.647
-Hello?
-It's me.

00:41:01.481 --> 00:41:02.440
Thank you.

00:41:03.275 --> 00:41:04.484
Don't thank me.

00:41:06.319 --> 00:41:08.863
I'm not doing it
because you still have feelings for me.

00:41:09.823 --> 00:41:12.909
I just don't want to
sink to your level as a person.

00:41:13.827 --> 00:41:14.995
So don't take it the wrong way.

00:41:18.581 --> 00:41:20.000
-Are you listening?
-Yeah.

00:41:20.709 --> 00:41:22.127
I heard everything you said.

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:23.586
I'll call you later.

00:41:30.719 --> 00:41:31.928
Oh, hey.

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:35.015
-The director wants to explain
-Yeah?

00:41:35.098 --> 00:41:36.683
the concept for today's shoot,

00:41:36.766 --> 00:41:38.143
-so he's waiting outside.
-Oh, okay.

00:41:38.226 --> 00:41:39.602
-Tell him to come in.
-Okay.

00:41:39.686 --> 00:41:41.855
But he mentioned the concept has changed.

00:41:41.938 --> 00:41:44.232
-Yeah, okay.
-Is that okay?

00:41:44.316 --> 00:41:46.151
-Yes, tell him to come in.
-All right.

00:41:46.234 --> 00:41:47.652
-Right, Gil-su.
-Yes?

00:41:47.736 --> 00:41:49.112
Today's shoot will finish
before 6 p.m., right?

00:41:49.195 --> 00:41:51.489
-Yes, likely so.
-Good.

00:41:54.951 --> 00:41:55.785
Director.

00:41:56.536 --> 00:41:58.288
Hello, Mr. Lim!

00:41:58.371 --> 00:42:00.790
-Hello.
-It's an honor to work with you again.

00:42:00.874 --> 00:42:03.126
Not at all. I look forward to it.

00:42:03.209 --> 00:42:05.170
Let me explain the concept for the shoot.

00:42:05.253 --> 00:42:07.756
-Did something change?
-Just a little bit.

00:42:07.839 --> 00:42:10.300
-I see.
-If you see here, this is a ballet outfit…

00:42:10.383 --> 00:42:11.801
Hold on.

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:15.847
I really shouldn't eat
since I'm on a diet.

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:17.682
If it's tasty, it's zero calories!

00:42:18.516 --> 00:42:19.642
Why is this so salty?

00:42:19.726 --> 00:42:22.395
I might kick the bucket eating this.

00:42:22.479 --> 00:42:23.396
Sir.

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.066
Artisan Ramyeon's soup is light and mild,

00:42:26.149 --> 00:42:28.068
so you won't kick the bucket!

00:42:28.151 --> 00:42:30.820
Man, I'm kind of hungry.

00:42:31.613 --> 00:42:34.199
But I'll probably regret eating ramyeon.

00:42:34.783 --> 00:42:37.786
Detective, if you don't eat it now,
you'll regret it until tomorrow.

00:42:37.869 --> 00:42:38.953
ARTISAN RAMYEON
MILD FLAVOR

00:42:41.664 --> 00:42:44.501
Worried it's nighttime?
Worried it's past midnight?

00:42:44.584 --> 00:42:47.629
Don't worry
Artisan Ramyeon is all good

00:42:47.712 --> 00:42:50.840
You can enjoy it without worries

00:42:50.924 --> 00:42:53.510
Tasty Artisan Ramyeon

00:42:53.593 --> 00:42:55.553
Let's all enjoy Artisan Ramyeon

00:42:55.637 --> 00:42:56.763
Artisan!

00:42:56.846 --> 00:42:57.972
I'm not doing it!

00:42:58.056 --> 00:42:59.849
Wearing a ramyeon packet costume
is bad enough as it is!

00:42:59.933 --> 00:43:02.143
Why does it always have to end
with Kang Pil-gu?

00:43:02.227 --> 00:43:05.730
Call Mr. Hwang, damn it.
Tell him I won't do this commercial!

00:43:05.814 --> 00:43:07.357
Come on, please. They'll kill me.

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.567
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not doing it.

00:43:10.151 --> 00:43:11.861
If it's tasty, it's zero calories.

00:43:12.487 --> 00:43:13.988
Artisan Ramyeon is…

00:43:14.572 --> 00:43:16.574
Cut! Let's go again.

00:43:26.835 --> 00:43:28.128
I'm sorry.

00:43:28.211 --> 00:43:30.463
Something urgent came up,
and the chief won't make it.

00:43:30.547 --> 00:43:32.090
Oh, really?

00:43:32.173 --> 00:43:35.051
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun is filming
a ramyeon commercial right now.

00:43:35.135 --> 00:43:38.096
The shoot is running longer than expected,
so he might not be able to make it.

00:43:38.179 --> 00:43:39.222
I'm so sorry about this.

00:43:39.305 --> 00:43:40.181
It's okay.

00:43:40.265 --> 00:43:43.226
-Please go ahead and order.
-Thank you.

00:43:44.686 --> 00:43:46.646
Let's all enjoy Artisan Ramyeon

00:43:46.729 --> 00:43:48.064
Artisan!

00:43:48.148 --> 00:43:49.149
Cut!

00:43:49.232 --> 00:43:51.651
We're losing steam, guys.

00:43:51.734 --> 00:43:52.652
Let's go again!

00:43:54.279 --> 00:43:55.155
Ready.

00:44:04.914 --> 00:44:06.833
…Artisan Ramyeon has chewy noodles,

00:44:06.916 --> 00:44:09.711
and the soup is absolutely delicious!

00:44:10.336 --> 00:44:11.171
Cut!

00:44:13.965 --> 00:44:15.300
Let's take a break, everyone!

00:44:28.813 --> 00:44:30.940
-Hyeon-jun, it's time to head back in.
-Okay.

00:44:32.025 --> 00:44:33.359
What time is it, Gil-su?

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:34.694
It's 6 o'clock.

00:44:36.571 --> 00:44:37.822
-It's 6 o'clock?
-Yes.

00:44:37.906 --> 00:44:39.449
Let's film this already.

00:44:42.827 --> 00:44:43.828
I got this!

00:44:43.912 --> 00:44:45.997
-Yes!
-Let's go.

00:44:47.248 --> 00:44:50.752
Detective, if you don't eat it now,
you'll regret it until tomorrow

00:44:50.835 --> 00:44:54.756
because Artisan Ramyeon has chewy noodles,
and the soup is absolutely delicious!

00:44:54.839 --> 00:44:58.009
Cut! Great job. That's a wrap!

00:45:01.262 --> 00:45:02.180
Great job!

00:45:02.805 --> 00:45:04.015
Hey, help me with this.

00:45:04.098 --> 00:45:05.350
Let's hurry up and go!

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:09.062
-Gil-su.
-Yes?

00:45:09.145 --> 00:45:10.313
How much further?

00:45:10.396 --> 00:45:12.148
We're almost there.

00:45:12.232 --> 00:45:14.359
All right. Just hurry, okay?

00:45:15.276 --> 00:45:16.319
How much longer?

00:45:16.402 --> 00:45:19.155
Not that much,
but the estimated time keeps increasing.

00:45:19.239 --> 00:45:20.114
Let's hurry up, okay?

00:45:20.198 --> 00:45:22.283
-I'll go as fast as I can.
-Okay, hurry up.

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:32.168
Go ahead and leave!

00:45:32.252 --> 00:45:34.420
Wait, not there! It's over here.

00:45:36.965 --> 00:45:37.799
Okay, go home!

00:45:38.633 --> 00:45:39.759
What's the matter with him?

00:45:44.222 --> 00:45:47.809
Ms. Wi, the reason I wanted to see you…

00:45:48.643 --> 00:45:50.645
Oh, here you are.

00:45:50.728 --> 00:45:52.730
What? Is the shoot over?

00:45:52.814 --> 00:45:54.857
-Bro, how did you--
-Hey, bro.

00:45:54.941 --> 00:45:58.861
Come on, bro. Take a seat.

00:45:58.945 --> 00:46:01.072
-But Hyeon-jun--
-Come on, bro.

00:46:01.155 --> 00:46:03.199
-How did you get here, Hyeon-jun?
-Well…

00:46:03.283 --> 00:46:04.867
I thought the shoot was running late.

00:46:06.494 --> 00:46:07.537
Well…

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:10.623
The shoot ended early
because it turned out well, bro.

00:46:10.707 --> 00:46:12.083
Oh, I see.

00:46:12.667 --> 00:46:14.377
Right, little bro.

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:16.629
-There wasn't any traffic on the way?
-None at all.

00:46:16.713 --> 00:46:18.256
Right, I see.

00:46:21.718 --> 00:46:22.594
It's been a while.

00:46:22.677 --> 00:46:24.012
Yes, hello.

00:46:25.138 --> 00:46:26.639
I thought you couldn't make it.

00:46:26.723 --> 00:46:28.516
No, I made it.

00:46:30.184 --> 00:46:31.394
Since it's about me,

00:46:31.477 --> 00:46:34.689
I came here to tell you myself.

00:46:40.778 --> 00:46:42.739
-Bro, did you tell her already?
-Tell her what?

00:46:42.822 --> 00:46:44.866
-My news.
-No, not at all.

00:46:44.949 --> 00:46:47.201
-Go ahead and tell her.
-Okay.

00:46:48.161 --> 00:46:49.495
Oh, I'm getting a call.

00:46:49.579 --> 00:46:51.247
-I have to take this.
-Okay.

00:47:06.179 --> 00:47:07.305
Have you been well?

00:47:08.514 --> 00:47:09.724
Yes.

00:47:10.516 --> 00:47:11.434
Right.

00:47:12.685 --> 00:47:14.729
-Have you been doing well?
-Yes.

00:47:15.229 --> 00:47:16.606
Of course, I have.

00:47:18.733 --> 00:47:21.527
Ms. Wi, I'm terribly sorry.

00:47:21.611 --> 00:47:23.154
Something urgent came up,
so I have to leave right now.

00:47:23.237 --> 00:47:24.989
The keywords for the article…

00:47:25.073 --> 00:47:26.658
Right. Little bro, you can tell her.

00:47:26.741 --> 00:47:28.034
-Me?
-Yes, that's right.

00:47:28.117 --> 00:47:30.161
I'll see you later, then.

00:47:30.244 --> 00:47:31.871
-Hey, but--
-Later!

00:47:35.583 --> 00:47:37.210
Oh, go ahead.

00:47:38.753 --> 00:47:41.631
What's the rush?

00:47:42.298 --> 00:47:44.258
Let's eat before we begin.

00:47:46.469 --> 00:47:48.304
But I'm done with dessert.

00:47:53.267 --> 00:47:54.977
I haven't eaten yet, though.

00:47:55.478 --> 00:48:00.441
The last order was 8 o'clock,
so the kitchen is already closed.

00:48:00.525 --> 00:48:02.193
I'm very sorry, sir.

00:48:03.861 --> 00:48:05.571
Do you know any nearby restaurants?

00:48:08.908 --> 00:48:10.827
My manager drives me around everywhere,

00:48:11.911 --> 00:48:15.915
and I've been on a diet lately,
so I don't know any good restaurants.

00:48:16.916 --> 00:48:17.959
I know a place we can go.

00:48:18.626 --> 00:48:19.460
Where…

00:48:21.295 --> 00:48:22.714
It's dark

00:48:23.131 --> 00:48:24.549
and secluded.

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:29.679
Jeez.

00:48:30.304 --> 00:48:34.434
Only teenagers come here
to eat ramyeon and make memories over it.

00:48:34.517 --> 00:48:36.728
I can't believe I'm doing this at my age.

00:48:37.311 --> 00:48:38.980
Then would you be okay
if someone took a photo

00:48:39.564 --> 00:48:41.482
of just the two of us eating at this hour?

00:48:44.861 --> 00:48:47.196
At least you got me
the ramyeon I'm promoting.

00:48:50.533 --> 00:48:53.327
You never watched Kang Pil-gu
or showed any interest in me,

00:48:53.411 --> 00:48:55.079
so how did you know to get this?

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:56.914
It was a coincidence.

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:04.130
Now, go ahead and tell me.
What's the story?

00:49:08.009 --> 00:49:11.679
Season five of Kang Pil-gu
has been confirmed.

00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:14.932
And Gwon Se-na is joining the cast.

00:49:16.768 --> 00:49:19.771
I guess it's good for the drama
that a global star is on board,

00:49:19.854 --> 00:49:22.982
but the main character has been
and always will be Kang Pil-gu.

00:49:23.065 --> 00:49:25.026
I don't want my fans to worry
that her character

00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:26.736
will take the spotlight from mine.

00:49:27.737 --> 00:49:29.530
Work that into the article, will you?

00:49:33.367 --> 00:49:34.911
I'll get started on the article.

00:50:26.963 --> 00:50:28.214
-What is it?
-What?

00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:30.383
Do you have something to say?

00:50:31.092 --> 00:50:31.926
No.

00:50:35.137 --> 00:50:36.097
Well,

00:50:37.098 --> 00:50:38.307
I'm thirsty.

00:50:38.808 --> 00:50:39.851
So?

00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:45.815
Do you have any water?

00:50:48.943 --> 00:50:49.861
I don't.

00:50:55.157 --> 00:50:55.992
Is your foot okay?

00:50:58.119 --> 00:51:01.038
You hurt your foot
breaking the window to help me.

00:51:01.122 --> 00:51:03.332
Wait, you remember that?

00:51:04.959 --> 00:51:05.793
Vaguely.

00:51:07.211 --> 00:51:09.255
It healed a long time ago.

00:51:10.089 --> 00:51:11.215
It's fine.

00:51:16.804 --> 00:51:17.763
So…

00:51:20.391 --> 00:51:21.309
I have

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:24.270
something to say.

00:51:31.861 --> 00:51:32.904
I'm sorry about before.

00:51:36.449 --> 00:51:38.159
For assuming that you worked as a hostess.

00:51:40.202 --> 00:51:41.287
I apologize for that.

00:51:54.133 --> 00:51:55.927
Hey, say something.

00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:59.805
I'm offering a sincere apology,
and I'm totally embarrassed.

00:51:59.889 --> 00:52:02.600
Do I have to accept your apology?

00:52:04.143 --> 00:52:05.102
Excuse me?

00:52:05.186 --> 00:52:06.187
I mean,

00:52:07.271 --> 00:52:09.440
it's only natural to accept an apology

00:52:09.523 --> 00:52:11.275
if someone owns up to their mistake.

00:52:11.359 --> 00:52:14.278
I didn't do anything unforgivable.
It was just a misunderstanding.

00:52:15.071 --> 00:52:17.740
It's only natural to apologize
if you did something wrong.

00:52:18.324 --> 00:52:20.076
But accepting the apology
is up to the other person.

00:52:20.868 --> 00:52:21.953
Unbelievable.

00:52:22.036 --> 00:52:24.997
I forgave you
for storming into the bathroom stall

00:52:25.081 --> 00:52:27.917
and humiliating me
while I was taking care of business.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.753
I even forgave you for spying on me
in my hospital room

00:52:30.836 --> 00:52:32.421
and gave you an exclusive.

00:52:32.505 --> 00:52:35.007
And I let you off the hook
for that article about my mom.

00:52:35.091 --> 00:52:36.509
You know what?

00:52:36.592 --> 00:52:40.304
After saying all that out loud,
I sound like a complete doormat!

00:52:40.805 --> 00:52:41.806
So?

00:52:42.848 --> 00:52:44.642
You really won't accept my apology?

00:52:45.643 --> 00:52:47.561
Even though
I'm personally giving you an exclusive

00:52:47.645 --> 00:52:49.313
and expressing how sorry I am?

00:52:49.397 --> 00:52:50.272
That's right.

00:52:52.066 --> 00:52:53.234
I don't want your apology.

00:53:07.123 --> 00:53:08.457
Seriously?

00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:15.172
Stop glaring at me and focus on the road!

00:53:15.256 --> 00:53:17.508
I have every right to glare at you!

00:53:19.218 --> 00:53:20.678
I forgot my wife's birthday today

00:53:20.761 --> 00:53:24.098
and finally got her to forgive me
after begging for hours,

00:53:24.181 --> 00:53:25.766
but then you called me back out!

00:53:25.850 --> 00:53:28.227
Gil-su couldn't come
because he was drinking!

00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:30.855
You could've called a driver
instead of your CEO!

00:53:30.938 --> 00:53:32.481
Or you could've driven yourself!

00:53:32.565 --> 00:53:35.067
I called you
because I have so much pent-up rage!

00:53:35.985 --> 00:53:36.986
Jeez.

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:41.532
What is it now?
Did you fight again with Ms. Wi?

00:53:41.615 --> 00:53:43.409
Who said we had a fight?

00:53:43.492 --> 00:53:46.328
I apologized for thinking
that she worked as a hostess,

00:53:46.412 --> 00:53:48.247
but she wouldn't accept my apology.

00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:51.375
I bet you acted all high and mighty
and gave a lousy apology.

00:53:51.459 --> 00:53:55.212
That's not true. I gave a sincere apology
for the first time in a while.

00:53:57.089 --> 00:53:58.257
Onion!

00:53:58.841 --> 00:53:59.800
What was that?

00:54:00.968 --> 00:54:02.344
Are you on Onion?

00:54:03.137 --> 00:54:05.264
I put something up for Seon-u, that's all.

00:54:05.347 --> 00:54:08.142
Seriously, the things you do…

00:54:23.449 --> 00:54:24.492
Go wash up and sleep.

00:54:24.575 --> 00:54:25.910
How are you getting home?

00:54:26.619 --> 00:54:29.371
I'm taking a taxi, of course.
You think I'll rent a scooter instead?

00:54:31.332 --> 00:54:32.166
Here.

00:54:33.125 --> 00:54:33.959
What's that?

00:54:34.543 --> 00:54:37.254
-Your wife's birthday gift.
-What?

00:54:39.215 --> 00:54:40.674
-What's this?
-Press the button.

00:54:49.850 --> 00:54:52.686
It's a bribe to keep her
from divorcing you over me.

00:54:53.896 --> 00:54:55.981
Oh, bro!

00:54:56.065 --> 00:54:59.235
-Bro, thanks so much!
-Jeez, go away.

00:54:59.318 --> 00:55:00.945
Gosh, would you look at that?

00:55:02.154 --> 00:55:05.074
Holy cow, it's a luxury car!

00:55:05.157 --> 00:55:07.618
I finally get to ride in one of these!

00:55:11.831 --> 00:55:12.998
Jeez.

00:55:14.792 --> 00:55:15.876
Are you home?

00:55:22.007 --> 00:55:23.092
Are you scared?

00:55:25.761 --> 00:55:27.096
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 2

00:55:27.179 --> 00:55:28.514
Damn it.

00:55:33.185 --> 00:55:34.854
Change your clothes first.

00:55:34.937 --> 00:55:36.647
I think I caught a cold.

00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:37.648
You caught a cold?

00:55:39.358 --> 00:55:41.277
That's why you need to dress warmly.

00:55:42.778 --> 00:55:43.863
Drink some water.

00:55:44.613 --> 00:55:45.656
Okay.

00:55:46.282 --> 00:55:48.325
Jeez, you're such a handful.

00:55:52.705 --> 00:55:55.166
Take two of these before you go to bed.

00:56:02.256 --> 00:56:03.340
What a bummer.

00:56:03.424 --> 00:56:05.092
I heard my bro Pil-gu
went on a blind date.

00:56:05.759 --> 00:56:07.344
-A blind date?
-Yeah.

00:56:07.428 --> 00:56:08.846
-With whom?
-How should I know?

00:56:08.929 --> 00:56:10.723
He probably has women lining up for him.

00:56:10.806 --> 00:56:12.349
Are you going to write about that too?

00:56:14.101 --> 00:56:17.021
I mean, it'd be better if I wrote it
and build up my track record.

00:56:17.104 --> 00:56:18.898
Jeez, you're really something.

00:56:19.481 --> 00:56:21.358
Don't you regret missing out on him?

00:56:21.442 --> 00:56:24.028
I mean, he's got the face,
the body, and the fame.

00:56:24.612 --> 00:56:25.613
Listen.

00:56:26.488 --> 00:56:27.489
How would you feel

00:56:28.449 --> 00:56:30.201
if you gave someone a genuine apology,

00:56:31.702 --> 00:56:33.162
but they refused to accept it?

00:56:35.664 --> 00:56:37.791
Did they do something really terrible?

00:56:40.085 --> 00:56:42.463
No, it wasn't that bad.

00:56:42.546 --> 00:56:44.882
I'd cut ties with them, then.

00:56:48.844 --> 00:56:51.847
Was it you who apologized,
or was it the other way around?

00:56:52.848 --> 00:56:53.766
It was me.

00:56:55.267 --> 00:56:56.560
I didn't accept the apology.

00:56:56.644 --> 00:56:57.519
Why not?

00:57:00.439 --> 00:57:01.941
Because when you accept an apology,

00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:04.360
it makes you expect more.

00:57:06.946 --> 00:57:09.406
That they'll treat you nicer,

00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:11.367
or that they'll be friendlier to you.

00:57:13.035 --> 00:57:15.120
It was never going to work out anyway,

00:57:16.664 --> 00:57:18.791
so I figured
I'd nip that expectation in the bud.

00:57:22.544 --> 00:57:24.213
Do you know what people call that?

00:57:24.838 --> 00:57:25.673
Putting up walls.

00:57:26.715 --> 00:57:28.550
If you keep putting up walls like that,

00:57:28.634 --> 00:57:30.803
you'll live alone forever.

00:57:30.886 --> 00:57:33.055
Whatever. I'm not taking these.

00:57:40.229 --> 00:57:42.231
-Hey, Su-ji.
-Yes?

00:57:43.482 --> 00:57:46.902
I've been in a bad mood
since this morning.

00:57:47.486 --> 00:57:48.362
Again?

00:57:50.531 --> 00:57:51.824
What do you mean "again"?

00:57:57.162 --> 00:58:00.958
Why would someone not accept an apology?

00:58:02.418 --> 00:58:04.586
I can't think of a good response.

00:58:07.006 --> 00:58:08.549
It figures.

00:58:08.632 --> 00:58:12.052
If I don't know the answer to that,
how would an AI assistant like you know?

00:58:23.522 --> 00:58:24.815
SPORTS EUNSEONG

00:58:29.528 --> 00:58:31.405
Jeez, did I really catch a cold?

00:58:34.616 --> 00:58:36.035
My throat hurts too.

"GLOBAL STAR GWON SE-NA JOINS CAST"

00:58:51.216 --> 00:58:52.426
I don't want your apology.

00:58:54.219 --> 00:58:56.472
Hey, I read an article
about Gwon Se-na joining your drama.

00:58:56.555 --> 00:58:57.723
Is it true?

00:58:58.307 --> 00:58:59.641
Right.

00:58:59.725 --> 00:59:02.353
So you read the article.

00:59:02.436 --> 00:59:05.189
You couldn't stand her at all.
Are you getting back together?

00:59:05.773 --> 00:59:06.648
Are you crazy?

00:59:06.732 --> 00:59:08.817
I'm just keeping
work and personal life separate.

00:59:10.736 --> 00:59:11.945
Where are you going anyway?

00:59:12.613 --> 00:59:15.824
My friend's grandfather passed away,
so I'm going to the funeral.

00:59:17.242 --> 00:59:20.120
But you've got an Onion deal today!

00:59:20.204 --> 00:59:21.121
The rice cooker!

00:59:21.205 --> 00:59:22.498
That's right.

00:59:22.581 --> 00:59:24.166
-It's almost time.
-Jeez.

00:59:24.249 --> 00:59:25.709
Can you go instead?

00:59:26.877 --> 00:59:28.712
I can't go out and sell a rice cooker.

00:59:28.796 --> 00:59:30.381
Everyone knows my face.

00:59:30.464 --> 00:59:31.632
It's dark out.

00:59:31.715 --> 00:59:33.050
Cover your face,
and nobody will recognize you.

00:59:33.133 --> 00:59:36.136
-No, absolutely not.
-My friend's waiting downstairs.

00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:37.679
Just grab it and head out, okay?

00:59:37.763 --> 00:59:40.265
-No way! I can't do it!
-Come on, help me out!

00:59:40.349 --> 00:59:41.517
I said no. Hey!

SEONGIL STATION

00:59:58.617 --> 01:00:02.162
Why'd they have to pick
such a crowded place to meet?

01:00:03.372 --> 01:00:04.665

Jeez.

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.748
You're here from Onion, right?

01:00:46.832 --> 01:00:47.833
What?

01:00:47.916 --> 01:00:50.002
Oh, that's right. Onion.

01:00:50.085 --> 01:00:51.545
-Is this it?
-Yes.

01:00:58.469 --> 01:00:59.470
Oh…

01:01:15.319 --> 01:01:17.404
I just sent you 320,000 won

01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:19.948
-Excuse me?
-Don't you use Onion Pay?

01:01:20.449 --> 01:01:23.076
-Check your app.
-Oh, I see.

I'm a fan of Lim Hyeon-jun.

01:01:33.337 --> 01:01:34.713
Oh, thank you.

01:01:34.796 --> 01:01:36.215
I have a whole box at home.

01:01:37.716 --> 01:01:38.675
Have a good night.

01:01:43.055 --> 01:01:44.097
Excuse me.

01:01:50.562 --> 01:01:51.438
Do you like…

01:01:52.898 --> 01:01:53.732
Lim Hyeon-jun?

01:01:54.316 --> 01:01:55.776
Yes, I do.

01:02:48.245 --> 01:02:49.955
It's the first time in my life.

01:02:51.290 --> 01:02:52.749
I've never liked someone…

01:02:54.167 --> 01:02:55.836
so unconditionally.

01:03:55.812 --> 01:03:57.522
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH YEON-SEO
FOR HER APPEARANCE

01:04:00.442 --> 01:04:02.986
-I'm a fan of Lim Hyeon-jun myself.
-Seriously?

01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:04.988
I love Kang Pil-gu.

01:04:05.072 --> 01:04:06.490
Wow, nice to meet you!

01:04:07.199 --> 01:04:09.993
How did you find out about this place?
I haven't told anyone!

01:04:10.077 --> 01:04:11.870
Hold on a second!

01:04:11.953 --> 01:04:13.121
Now what?

01:04:13.205 --> 01:04:15.624
As far as cursed connections go,
ours is the worst.

01:04:15.707 --> 01:04:17.709
I can share some with you if you'd like.

01:04:17.793 --> 01:04:19.586
You seem like a bigger fan than me.

01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:22.798
I actually look a lot like Lim Hyeon-jun.

01:04:22.881 --> 01:04:24.508
You're joking.

01:04:24.591 --> 01:04:25.634
Want to check for yourself?

01:04:25.717 --> 01:04:27.302
How about this Friday?
