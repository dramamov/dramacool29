00:00:06.646 --> 00:00:10.855
Kyohachi-ryu School,
the origin of swordsmanship.

00:00:10.938 --> 00:00:17.938
Its legend was believed
to have ended long ago.

00:00:18.021 --> 00:00:25.021
Yet eight successors lived on,
silently immersing themselves in training.

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:39.313
Don't screw with me!

00:00:55.396 --> 00:00:57.938
What's wrong, Iroha?
Is that all you've got?

00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:00.105
Shut up, Sansuke!

00:01:27.938 --> 00:01:29.605
You win, Shikura.

00:01:29.688 --> 00:01:32.521
If you were playing seriously,
it'd be a different story.

00:01:41.646 --> 00:01:42.813
Another one for me.

00:01:42.896 --> 00:01:45.521
Huh? You're going
for another round, Jinroku?

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:48.271
You've had, what, ten bowls?

00:01:48.355 --> 00:01:49.396
Amazing.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.396
By the way, I heard Satsuma
and Choshu have joined forces.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.396
I wonder if the Edo shogunate
or the anti-shogunate will win.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.230
Obviously whichever side
knows how to use us effectively.

00:01:58.313 --> 00:02:00.188
-Right, Shu-nii?
-Yeah, that's right.

00:02:00.688 --> 00:02:02.105
Can we join the war too?

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:04.188
That's for Master to decide.

00:02:04.271 --> 00:02:08.021
I can't wait to fight.
We've trained so hard all these years.

00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:10.855
Oh, please.
Any side Sansuke joins is gonna lose.

00:02:10.938 --> 00:02:14.396
Come on, Iroha. You're the one who cries
when I beat you in training.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.313
What?

00:02:15.813 --> 00:02:17.688
Look who's talking.

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:20.980
-You tripped earlier too, remember?
-Huh? I didn't trip.

00:02:30.355 --> 00:02:31.521
I know.

00:02:32.646 --> 00:02:34.438
I don't have much time left.

00:02:37.646 --> 00:02:38.646
It's tomorrow.

00:03:11.105 --> 00:03:14.271
There is something I must tell you all.

00:03:15.771 --> 00:03:21.188
You have endured harsh training together
for nearly ten years.

00:03:23.605 --> 00:03:24.521
But…

00:03:26.438 --> 00:03:28.521
that ends today.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.688
The Kyohachi-ryu School shall be
passed down to a single successor.

00:03:40.563 --> 00:03:44.313
Only one person can inherit it.

00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:49.021
You must kill each other.

00:03:52.396 --> 00:03:56.230
You will begin tomorrow
when the sun reaches due south.

00:03:57.063 --> 00:04:00.271
You must forget that you are siblings.

00:04:01.355 --> 00:04:03.688
No one is allowed to flee.

00:04:19.813 --> 00:04:21.146
This is our fate.

00:04:23.355 --> 00:04:24.980
We all knew it would come to this.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:26.813
Listen,

00:04:27.896 --> 00:04:29.563
why don't we leave the mountain?

00:04:30.105 --> 00:04:33.313
We could live somewhere secluded,
where Master won't find us.

00:04:33.396 --> 00:04:35.105
-As long as we're together--
-No.

00:04:35.188 --> 00:04:36.521
Gentosai will come after us.

00:04:36.605 --> 00:04:38.688
Master was just trying to scare us.

00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:40.730
No, he's out there.

00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:44.938
I once saw him talking with Master.

00:04:46.646 --> 00:04:50.063
That man… is a monster.

00:04:51.938 --> 00:04:54.480
Ever since we mastered
the art of the Kyohachi-ryu School,

00:04:54.563 --> 00:04:56.896
we have known this day would come.

00:04:57.813 --> 00:04:58.813
This…

00:05:00.021 --> 00:05:02.188
is our fate.

00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:03.688
Yes.

00:05:08.313 --> 00:05:09.188
We have no choice.

00:05:30.438 --> 00:05:31.480
Shu-nii…

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.771
What should we do?

00:06:56.313 --> 00:06:58.188
Well, well…

00:07:15.938 --> 00:07:18.230
So, how many casualties on our side?

00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:19.646
We lost 15.

00:07:20.938 --> 00:07:23.855
Kokushu the Manslayer
is absolutely insane.

00:07:24.813 --> 00:07:26.230
What did the organizer say?

00:07:26.313 --> 00:07:31.605
The rules do not explicitly forbid
killing our troops, so the game continues.

00:07:31.688 --> 00:07:34.021
How unexpected.

00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:37.355
Shujiro Saga has already been informed.

00:07:40.813 --> 00:07:43.813
A total of 192 participants
have been eliminated.

00:07:43.896 --> 00:07:47.146
Also, number 19, Ukyo Kikuomi,
the first to leave Tenryuji Temple,

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.146
has been eliminated.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:50.521
What a shame.

00:07:50.605 --> 00:07:54.313
Reportedly, he lost in a duel
against Bukotsu Kanjiya.

00:07:54.396 --> 00:07:59.521
Bukotsu the Savage Slasher.
He looks like another promising player.

00:08:02.355 --> 00:08:05.980
Gentlemen, if you're ready,
shall we begin?

00:08:07.605 --> 00:08:11.730
Of course. That's what
we're all here to enjoy, isn't it?

00:08:13.313 --> 00:08:17.480
Now then, allow me to explain
the betting process once more.

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:19.730
What you'll be predicting is

00:08:19.813 --> 00:08:23.355
which participant will be the first
to pass through the next post station.

00:08:23.855 --> 00:08:26.896
Our opening bet is on
the first participant to pass Seki-juku,

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.313
after crossing the Suzuka Pass.

00:08:29.396 --> 00:08:31.646
Place your bets, everyone.

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:36.646
My bet's on number 66, Bukotsu Kanjiya.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.605
The Suzuka Pass is no easy path.

00:08:38.688 --> 00:08:41.938
You won't get through a fight this fierce
without his level of skill.

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:45.021
Number 200, Naoto Yoshida.
Number 201, Shoji Yoshida.

00:08:45.105 --> 00:08:46.855
Oh, yes…

00:08:46.938 --> 00:08:49.188
The spear twins.

00:08:49.271 --> 00:08:51.146
Mr. Sakakibara likes to be unconventional.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.688
Their spear work
at Tenryuji Temple was exceptional.

00:08:53.771 --> 00:08:56.146
A solid bet, I'd say.

00:08:56.813 --> 00:08:58.563
Number 33, Kyojin Tsuge.

00:08:58.646 --> 00:09:00.980
Oh? As for me,

00:09:01.063 --> 00:09:03.438
I'll go with number 108, Shujiro Saga.

00:09:05.438 --> 00:09:07.188
All bets are now on the table.

00:09:07.271 --> 00:09:10.813
Let us proceed with the first round.

00:09:10.896 --> 00:09:12.813
Please enjoy to your heart's content.

00:09:21.563 --> 00:09:25.646
SUZUKA PASS, MIE

00:09:43.188 --> 00:09:44.605
The mountain pass begins here.

00:09:45.563 --> 00:09:48.063
You won't get to Seki-juku
without crossing it.

00:09:48.563 --> 00:09:51.605
There will be a lot of participants here.
Stay close.

00:09:53.646 --> 00:09:54.480
Yes, sir.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:00.980
What's the matter?

00:10:07.146 --> 00:10:10.896
"Kokushu the Manslayer,"
a man who knew only how to kill.

00:10:14.021 --> 00:10:17.730
What has your life been like, Shujiro?

00:10:20.855 --> 00:10:21.980
I…

00:10:23.771 --> 00:10:26.396
I grew up in the mountains
with my siblings.

00:10:27.396 --> 00:10:28.313
Siblings?

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:33.230
We were all orphans taken in by Master.
We shared no blood ties.

00:10:34.605 --> 00:10:35.771
And there,

00:10:37.563 --> 00:10:40.771
we learned nothing but how to kill.

00:10:45.438 --> 00:10:47.771
Did you live there all your life?

00:10:47.855 --> 00:10:52.521
No. After that, I cut down men in Kyoto
as a bodyguard for the Satsuma domain.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:58.480
I kept killing through the war,
and before I knew it…

00:11:00.688 --> 00:11:03.271
they were calling me
Kokushu the Manslayer.

00:11:41.813 --> 00:11:43.021
Stay alert.

00:11:57.188 --> 00:11:58.688
You survived Tenryuji Temple?

00:12:00.313 --> 00:12:03.355
You? You're with a child
and can't even draw your sword.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:33.980
Naoto!

00:12:35.271 --> 00:12:36.938
Futaba, run!

00:12:54.313 --> 00:12:55.688
Futaba!

00:13:02.271 --> 00:13:03.855
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

00:13:17.521 --> 00:13:18.730
Is this…

00:13:26.771 --> 00:13:27.938
Someone's nearby.

00:13:40.271 --> 00:13:43.105
I've been waiting
a long time for you, Shujiro Saga.

00:13:43.188 --> 00:13:44.563
Iroha!

00:13:44.646 --> 00:13:46.855
Stop! I won't fight my little sister!

00:13:46.938 --> 00:13:48.480
Save your words!

00:13:49.021 --> 00:13:52.646
Do you have any idea
what happened to us because of you?

00:13:55.271 --> 00:13:58.271
Can you imagine what your own
brothers felt when you left them behind?!

00:13:59.313 --> 00:14:00.355
Since I left the mountain,

00:14:00.438 --> 00:14:03.771
I've lived every day as if I were dead.

00:14:06.896 --> 00:14:08.271
I'm sorry.

00:14:49.438 --> 00:14:50.438
Move back!

00:14:50.521 --> 00:14:51.813
Iroha!

00:14:52.313 --> 00:14:53.480
Come.

00:14:59.938 --> 00:15:01.521
Iroha, go in front!

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:48.480
Defend yourself. Unless you want to die.

00:16:12.146 --> 00:16:13.313
Get closer!

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.063
Surround them! Closer!

00:16:19.855 --> 00:16:21.355
-Move up!
-Closer!

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.438
No! Get back here!

00:16:27.438 --> 00:16:28.563
Gojiro!

00:16:28.646 --> 00:16:30.021
Stay back! Keep your distance!

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:33.521
Aim for the brat!

00:16:33.605 --> 00:16:35.438
That brat! Go after her!

00:16:52.313 --> 00:16:54.521
Take down the brat and the woman!

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.396
Who is he?

00:17:27.521 --> 00:17:28.813
He's gonna kill me!

00:17:45.063 --> 00:17:46.355
Sheathe your sword.

00:17:48.688 --> 00:17:50.271
Why did you help us?

00:17:52.605 --> 00:17:54.146
Among our people,

00:17:56.438 --> 00:18:00.105
taking the life of a child
is believed to be the greatest evil.

00:18:00.813 --> 00:18:05.271
We honor those who shield children
and do not wish to fight them.

00:18:05.355 --> 00:18:07.688
Why would we believe you so easily?

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:20.313
Wait…

00:18:24.355 --> 00:18:25.938
Thank you.

00:18:28.105 --> 00:18:29.563
May I ask your name?

00:18:31.521 --> 00:18:32.771
Kamuykocha.

00:18:37.063 --> 00:18:39.688
As long as that child is with you,
I will not strike.

00:18:43.855 --> 00:18:45.730
Kamuykocha…

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.355
-He's Ainu.
-Ainu?

00:18:48.438 --> 00:18:50.230
The indigenous people of Hokkaido.

00:18:50.313 --> 00:18:52.313
I saw them at the Battle of Hakodate.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:56.646
So it's true that the newspapers
made it all the way to Hokkaido.

00:19:00.855 --> 00:19:02.938
We can pass through Seki-juku with these.

00:19:03.938 --> 00:19:06.021
More participants
will be coming from behind.

00:19:06.105 --> 00:19:07.230
We need to hurry.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.771
Iroha,

00:19:12.355 --> 00:19:13.396
take this one.

00:19:20.313 --> 00:19:22.271
If you really want to kill me,

00:19:23.438 --> 00:19:25.063
then do it in Tokyo.

00:19:37.105 --> 00:19:38.105
Wait.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.980
I'll go with you.

00:19:50.771 --> 00:19:53.021
There's still something you need to do.

00:19:55.896 --> 00:19:57.771
You can't just walk away from it.

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.063
All right.

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:22.646
Is one enough?

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.646
Carrying too many is risky. Let's move.

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:25.605
Yes.

00:20:46.063 --> 00:20:46.980
Come in.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.855
Pardon the intrusion.

00:20:52.396 --> 00:20:54.813
I'm here to report
on the investigation progress.

00:20:55.396 --> 00:20:57.021
The Kyoto Prefectural Office

00:20:57.105 --> 00:20:59.813
has discovered bloodstains
and dismembered human remains.

00:20:59.896 --> 00:21:02.271
They reported numerous eyewitness accounts

00:21:02.355 --> 00:21:05.563
of sword duels involving individuals
believed to be shizoku.

00:21:06.938 --> 00:21:09.438
Furthermore, the location
of the eyewitness accounts

00:21:09.521 --> 00:21:14.563
has been gradually shifting over time,
from Shiga to Mie.

00:21:14.646 --> 00:21:17.563
You're saying the shizoku
are fighting with each other as they move?

00:21:17.646 --> 00:21:18.771
Indeed.

00:21:19.355 --> 00:21:20.396
And…

00:21:21.521 --> 00:21:24.355
they appear to be
heading toward Tokyo from Kyoto.

00:21:25.271 --> 00:21:27.105
At least that's how it looks.

00:21:27.188 --> 00:21:29.146
So they're moving toward us?

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:30.896
There's more.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.563
The reports say numerous gunshots
were heard at Tenryuji Temple.

00:21:36.605 --> 00:21:37.771
Lord Okubo.

00:21:37.855 --> 00:21:42.396
A large number of shizoku armed with guns
and swords are approaching Tokyo.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:47.063
Which implies that discontented shizoku
are plotting a civil uprising--

00:21:47.146 --> 00:21:51.271
If they were plotting a civil uprising,
they wouldn't need to cut each other down.

00:21:51.355 --> 00:21:52.230
But sir…

00:21:57.146 --> 00:21:58.188
I understand.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.063
If ignored, it may escalate
into a national crisis.

00:22:02.563 --> 00:22:06.188
Kawaji, track down the source
of the guns immediately.

00:22:06.271 --> 00:22:09.813
Maejima, analyze all telegram
communications from the past month.

00:22:09.896 --> 00:22:12.438
-There might be traces left behind.
-Yes, sir.

00:22:26.355 --> 00:22:28.146
TENRYUJI TEMPLE

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:37.271
SEKI

00:22:46.771 --> 00:22:49.188
SEKI-JUKU

00:22:49.271 --> 00:22:52.063
REQUIRED POINTS: THREE

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.063
We're almost at the exit.

00:23:06.146 --> 00:23:08.480
There should be someone here
to check our tags.

00:23:36.355 --> 00:23:38.271
No need to be so wary.

00:23:39.605 --> 00:23:42.563
I am Tsurubami,
in charge of overseeing your passage.

00:23:43.313 --> 00:23:44.938
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

00:23:48.521 --> 00:23:49.980
Now, your wooden tags, please.

00:23:59.813 --> 00:24:02.105
Shujiro Saga, three points.

00:24:03.063 --> 00:24:04.563
Futaba Katsuki, three points.

00:24:05.188 --> 00:24:07.146
Iroha Kinugasa, five points.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.021
You are all cleared to pass.

00:24:13.188 --> 00:24:15.063
This is for you, Miss Kinugasa.

00:24:18.438 --> 00:24:20.521
This red tag counts for three points.

00:24:21.105 --> 00:24:24.355
In exchange, hand over three tags
other than the one around your neck.

00:24:26.188 --> 00:24:27.188
Tsurubami, was it?

00:24:29.063 --> 00:24:29.896
Yes.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.855
What is the purpose of this game?

00:24:31.938 --> 00:24:32.980
I cannot answer that.

00:24:33.063 --> 00:24:34.438
Let me put it another way.

00:24:36.396 --> 00:24:37.896
Who are you people?

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.688
I cannot answer that either.

00:24:40.188 --> 00:24:41.230
That said…

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:49.355
I believe you and Kinugasa
are well acquainted with "Kodoku."

00:24:51.563 --> 00:24:52.938
What are you implying?

00:24:55.396 --> 00:24:56.688
Three bugs.

00:25:05.146 --> 00:25:08.230
Well then, may your journey go well.

00:25:32.313 --> 00:25:33.313
Gentlemen,

00:25:35.021 --> 00:25:38.271
we've confirmed all participants
have passed through Seki-juku.

00:25:38.355 --> 00:25:40.355
And the result?

00:25:40.438 --> 00:25:42.855
The first participant to reach Seki-juku…

00:25:44.813 --> 00:25:46.271
was number 33, Kyojin Tsuge.

00:25:46.355 --> 00:25:47.355
Yes!

00:25:49.938 --> 00:25:53.063
Looks like I've won this round.

00:25:54.105 --> 00:25:55.105
Darn it!

00:25:56.563 --> 00:25:58.063
Well, I'll be damned.

00:25:58.563 --> 00:26:00.438
No surprise for a former ninja from Iga.

00:26:01.438 --> 00:26:04.938
Morosawa, maybe we went a little too far
taking a long shot, huh?

00:26:05.521 --> 00:26:06.855
It's only the first round.

00:26:06.938 --> 00:26:08.938
We've got plenty
of chances left to recover.

00:26:09.021 --> 00:26:10.188
I see.

00:26:10.271 --> 00:26:13.021
And then there's number 277, Kamuykocha.

00:26:13.105 --> 00:26:15.063
I never expected
the Ainu to join this game.

00:26:15.146 --> 00:26:19.188
Well now, this is getting unpredictable.

00:26:19.271 --> 00:26:22.730
Honestly, I can't be
thankful enough to the organizer

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.605
for providing us with so much fun.

00:26:25.688 --> 00:26:27.271
Much obliged.

00:26:27.355 --> 00:26:31.188
Now then, let us proceed
with the second bet.

00:26:31.855 --> 00:26:33.688
Our second bet is on the first participant

00:26:33.771 --> 00:26:36.605
to pass through
the next checkpoint, Chiryu-juku.

00:26:43.355 --> 00:26:48.063
YOKKAICHI-JUKU

00:26:59.105 --> 00:27:00.563
You must be Mr. Saga.

00:27:01.563 --> 00:27:05.188
We've been expecting you. Please, come in.

00:27:21.063 --> 00:27:22.563
I knew you'd show up.

00:27:23.188 --> 00:27:26.938
No surprise. A seasoned warrior
like you has a sharp sense of survival.

00:27:27.688 --> 00:27:29.355
Why did you choose Yokkaichi?

00:27:29.438 --> 00:27:31.521
I told you I'm a strategist, remember?

00:27:31.605 --> 00:27:33.563
The Suzuka Pass is no easy path.

00:27:34.063 --> 00:27:37.646
Bringing along a girl who can't even
fight must've been a pain, huh?

00:27:38.396 --> 00:27:42.146
I figured it must be about time
you're hoping to form an alliance.

00:27:45.271 --> 00:27:46.105
What's this?

00:27:46.646 --> 00:27:50.438
Not just the little miss, huh?
You've got quite the beauty tagging along.

00:27:50.521 --> 00:27:53.771
-Quiet.
-Don't count on it. Kyojin here.

00:27:54.521 --> 00:27:57.521
Pleased to meet you, Iroha Kinugasa.

00:27:58.188 --> 00:27:59.646
How do you know my name?

00:28:00.605 --> 00:28:02.896
Like I said, I'm a strategist.

00:28:06.355 --> 00:28:07.396
Kyojin.

00:28:10.688 --> 00:28:12.980
I do not trust you.

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:14.938
However…

00:28:16.521 --> 00:28:19.188
I came here to improve
my chances of survival.

00:28:22.396 --> 00:28:24.230
Do you know what Kodoku really means?

00:28:27.105 --> 00:28:28.730
Three bugs, right?

00:28:29.438 --> 00:28:30.271
Yeah.

00:28:34.188 --> 00:28:38.021
This is how you write Kodoku.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:45.438
A hundred insects are sealed in a jar
and made to fight to the death.

00:28:46.355 --> 00:28:49.146
Only the last one left alive
becomes a god

00:28:49.688 --> 00:28:52.188
and gains the power to slaughter all.

00:28:53.438 --> 00:28:55.355
You know your stuff.

00:28:57.813 --> 00:28:59.730
Once, Iroha and I…

00:29:01.146 --> 00:29:03.146
were bugs inside that jar.

00:29:16.188 --> 00:29:19.855
So this is your second time?
You two lead quite the life.

00:29:23.563 --> 00:29:28.271
Well, anyway, if this really
is that type of Kodoku,

00:29:28.855 --> 00:29:32.480
it means only one person
will survive to the end.

00:29:34.438 --> 00:29:38.063
Are you prepared to kill

00:29:39.813 --> 00:29:41.896
those you once fought alongside?

00:29:46.355 --> 00:29:48.938
I've got someone I need to save.

00:29:50.855 --> 00:29:52.021
But…

00:29:53.521 --> 00:29:56.271
It doesn't mean I'm going to play
this game on their terms.

00:30:03.563 --> 00:30:06.896
Looks like I was right
to reach out to you.

00:30:09.438 --> 00:30:13.480
We're allies now, Kokushu Saga.

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:19.605
What's that?

00:30:19.688 --> 00:30:23.230
It's called a handshake.
You just grab each other's hands.

00:30:23.313 --> 00:30:24.563
It's a foreign greeting.

00:30:24.646 --> 00:30:28.146
It means, "I'm not holding anything
in my hands and I trust you."

00:30:40.938 --> 00:30:41.938
You too, little miss.

00:30:46.021 --> 00:30:47.021
I'm Futaba Katsuki.

00:30:47.105 --> 00:30:48.355
A pleasure.

00:30:50.438 --> 00:30:51.438
What is it?

00:30:52.105 --> 00:30:55.938
Making us kill each other like this…

00:30:57.063 --> 00:30:59.063
What does the organizer really want?

00:31:00.188 --> 00:31:02.313
Even offering such a huge sum of money.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.813
Exactly. That's the real problem.

00:31:06.896 --> 00:31:09.230
If we don't learn
what they're really after,

00:31:09.313 --> 00:31:12.605
we'll end up dancing
in the palm of their hand.

00:31:13.313 --> 00:31:15.396
So you've got a plan?

00:31:16.146 --> 00:31:19.646
That's why I brought up
the idea of an alliance.

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:21.646
What exactly are you planning?

00:31:24.688 --> 00:31:27.563
We're going to find out
what this Kodoku really is.

00:31:28.605 --> 00:31:31.313
And to do that,
I want to run an experiment.

00:31:31.396 --> 00:31:32.896
An experiment?

00:31:37.105 --> 00:31:38.813
Well, I'll explain the details tomorrow.

00:31:38.896 --> 00:31:41.146
Something to look forward to.

00:31:42.021 --> 00:31:44.146
Make sure you get a good rest today, okay?

00:31:51.896 --> 00:31:55.938
KODOKU

00:31:56.021 --> 00:31:57.355
You must kill each other.

00:32:44.771 --> 00:32:45.896
Shu-nii.

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:49.730
Where are you going?

00:32:52.021 --> 00:32:53.271
The bathroom.

00:33:34.605 --> 00:33:35.688
No…

00:33:38.355 --> 00:33:39.521
Gentosai?

00:34:45.021 --> 00:34:46.896
Why are you traveling with that child?

00:34:50.688 --> 00:34:54.313
We met at Tenryuji Temple
and have been traveling together since.

00:34:54.396 --> 00:34:55.563
That's all.

00:34:56.855 --> 00:34:59.146
You really think she can survive this?

00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:08.855
After leaving us behind,

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.813
is this some kind of atonement?

00:35:33.396 --> 00:35:34.563
Iroha,

00:35:36.521 --> 00:35:38.563
what happened after I left?

00:35:39.563 --> 00:35:40.938
Please tell me.

00:35:48.688 --> 00:35:49.938
Master…

00:35:51.688 --> 00:35:54.688
He feared the techniques
of Kyohachi-ryu School might be leaked.

00:35:55.688 --> 00:35:57.646
So he tried to kill us all.

00:36:01.646 --> 00:36:03.271
Ikkan-nii…

00:36:04.855 --> 00:36:08.605
He stood up to Master so we could escape.

00:36:11.938 --> 00:36:15.063
Thanks to him, we were able
to get off the mountain.

00:36:17.146 --> 00:36:18.521
We were scattered.

00:36:22.771 --> 00:36:25.980
Just because I am a woman,
I wasn't allowed to hold a sword.

00:36:31.855 --> 00:36:33.355
I've spent my life

00:36:35.438 --> 00:36:37.355
running from Gentosai.

00:36:42.313 --> 00:36:43.896
Everything that happened

00:36:45.355 --> 00:36:47.855
is all because you ran away back then.

00:36:59.271 --> 00:37:00.480
Please forgive me.

00:37:16.605 --> 00:37:18.396
Why did you join Kodoku?

00:37:21.355 --> 00:37:23.605
My wife is suffering from cholera.

00:37:25.771 --> 00:37:27.271
My daughter is dead.

00:37:28.896 --> 00:37:31.688
It's only a matter of time
before my son becomes sick too.

00:37:32.438 --> 00:37:34.355
But I don't have the money for medicine.

00:37:34.438 --> 00:37:35.438
I see.

00:37:38.105 --> 00:37:40.230
So you're a father now.

00:37:43.688 --> 00:37:44.563
And you, Iroha?

00:37:46.396 --> 00:37:48.230
Why did you join Kodoku?

00:37:50.896 --> 00:37:53.271
You told me I still
have something I need to do.

00:37:59.021 --> 00:38:01.105
I'm not sure if I want to involve you.

00:38:03.938 --> 00:38:05.605
I need to think more.

00:38:19.313 --> 00:38:20.480
Iroha.

00:38:26.313 --> 00:38:28.230
I ran away back then.

00:38:32.105 --> 00:38:38.105
But I have no intention of running

00:38:39.646 --> 00:38:41.480
from the suffering I caused you all.

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:44.146
And yet,

00:38:45.896 --> 00:38:48.355
getting to see you again, alive…

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.730
is something I'm truly grateful for.

00:39:19.105 --> 00:39:21.188
We need two more to pass through Chiryu.

00:39:22.021 --> 00:39:24.896
I guess we should win them now,
while there are plenty around.

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:26.771
There's a ferry at Miya-juku.

00:39:27.605 --> 00:39:29.188
The participants are bound to--

00:39:43.521 --> 00:39:44.813
Your face.

00:39:45.438 --> 00:39:46.313
What?

00:39:50.938 --> 00:39:53.271
Maybe I was wrong.

00:39:54.146 --> 00:39:56.230
What's this guy mumbling about?

00:40:46.146 --> 00:40:49.688
Not here either…

00:41:20.646 --> 00:41:22.271
Gentosai.

00:41:27.521 --> 00:41:28.771
Any leads?

00:41:29.271 --> 00:41:30.105
Yes.

00:41:37.813 --> 00:41:38.813
Enter.

00:41:41.271 --> 00:41:44.438
-We've identified where the guns are from.
-Where?

00:41:44.521 --> 00:41:47.938
When we looked into the records
from the smuggler we arrested recently,

00:41:48.521 --> 00:41:52.313
we confirmed that a large shipment
was brought in from Britain to Yokohama.

00:41:57.271 --> 00:42:01.271
The shipment contained
over a hundred Snider rifles.

00:42:02.063 --> 00:42:07.146
Impossible. A lone smuggler couldn't
possibly afford that many rifles.

00:42:08.021 --> 00:42:10.855
Right. It seems he had clients.

00:42:11.938 --> 00:42:12.813
Who?

00:42:18.605 --> 00:42:19.521
Mitsui.

00:42:21.771 --> 00:42:22.730
Sumitomo.

00:42:25.188 --> 00:42:26.313
Yasuda.

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:29.396
Mitsubishi.

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:32.938
Behind this incident…

00:42:35.521 --> 00:42:41.188
are the four powerful zaibatsu
supporting the Meiji government.

00:43:05.855 --> 00:43:09.063
95 REMAINING

00:46:48.355 --> 00:46:51.855
