[Episode 24]

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.350
Thank you.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.210
Why are you still carrying a sword?

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.479
It's how I make my living.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.940
I must keep it with me.

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.400
Making a living with your sword?

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.640
Don't tell me you're an assassin.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.850
You jest, Sir.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.430
I've loved playing the pipa
since childhood.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.170
But as I grew older,

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.690
I couldn't survive on pipa alone.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.639
So I found a master
to teach me sword dance.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.050
Today I brought both my sword

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.630
and my pipa.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.230
You may choose which you prefer,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.470
or I can play the pipa first,
then dance with my sword.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.710
Your voice

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.560
hasn't changed at all.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.690
Are you the guest
sitting in the main seat?

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.540
I've never heard your voice before.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.280

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.079
Have you mistaken her for someone else?

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:44.910
Nu Jiao

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.960
is blind.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.150
How did you lose your sight?

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.490
You must have mistaken her
for someone else.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.050
Let's start with the sword dance then.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.910
Sword dance is a treasure
of our Tang Empire,

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.560
and many women know how to perform it.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.660
But a blind performer like you...

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.520
Is quite rare, really.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.960
The lady who guided me earlier—

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.960
could you please hold my pipa?

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.430
Thank you.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.250
Though I'm blind,

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.680
I pray this longsword spares all present,

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.120

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.340

on the poetry boards at Stations,

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.070
among poems about Cold Food and Qingming,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.510
this one is copied most frequently.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.430
Time flows like a long river.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.680
Poets are countless.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.290
Actually, for a poet,

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.600
if just one poem

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.600
is still recited 1,000 years later,

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.260
that'll be truly remarkable.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.970

Even now,
when the Cold Food Festival comes,

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.410
I still copy and recite it.

No, Master. That's all we have.

Our Xuanhuo Troupe

Indeed, 2 songstresses

in comparison with this lady.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.830
In my opinion, to determine the winner,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.380
we shouldn't care about
whose poems have been sung more.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.670
Instead, we should consider

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.800

by the troupe's top courtesan.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:31.150
Afraid of being bullied,

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.630
I learned a few moves.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.360
I even thought about becoming an assassin.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.840
But my skills are too poor.

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:37.320
You can't even beat me,

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.790
so you'd better find another profession.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:40.440
Mr. Ruan.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:42.560
She's all yours.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.250
Where is the leader?

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.660
Come out and speak!

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.360
I'm here.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.150
I wouldn't dare to lie.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.080
This woman is indeed not

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.610
part of our Xuanhuo Troupe.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:57.150
On our way here,

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.030
we happened to find her
about to hang herself.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.720
So...

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:06.990
Our leader is kind-hearted.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.240
Seeing that she can play the pipa

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.600
and dance with swords, he...

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.250
He took her in.

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:14.990
Yes, yes.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.240
Hanging yourself while carrying a sword?

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.720
Do you particularly enjoy being strangled?

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:23.270
I'm afraid the suicide attempt
was just a trap.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.470
She must have known beforehand

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.730
that the Xuanhuo Troupe
was coming to Ruan's Restaurant

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.240
and deliberately waited for you there.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:36.720
Mr. Ruan,

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.000
who hired this troupe?

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.840
The manager surnamed Hou.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.360
He wanted to harm me!

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:50.720
Catch him!

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:52.960
Stop!

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.320
Come here!

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:56.390
Let me go!

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.380
Release me!

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:58.150
Come here!

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:01.080
Kneel!

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:04.880
Trying to run?

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.750
So you admit it?

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:08.480
Yes, it was me.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.349
I hired an assassin

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.940
to kill you all because you're unfilial!

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.750
So what?

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:16.210
You run a restaurant,

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.920
yet spend all day reading, memorizing,
and writing poetry.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.210
Just to socialize with poets,

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:21.510
you're willing to spend a fortune.

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:23.030
You're about to squander

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.349
all of your father's assets!

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:25.829
I can't stand it!

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.510
Before your father died, he told me,

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.490
"If he is worthy of support,

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:33.350
then support him.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.830
If he's not,

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.480
you..."

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.110
"You

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:43.440
may take his place."

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:50.270
What he just said

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:51.640
sounds so familiar.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.380
I think a poet wrote it before.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:56.960
You're truly obsessed with poetry.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.000
Those words

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.020
aren't from any poem.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:00.920
No?

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.790
It's from the Late Eastern Han
and the Three Kingdoms,

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:04.790
when Liu Xuande entrusted his son

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.200
to Zhuge Kongming at Baidi City.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.280
Right, right.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.110
Right, right.

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:10.750
I remember now.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.240
Hou.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.230
Your loyalty to my father

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.510
is commendable.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.400
I thank you for that.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.590
Well...

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.020
I love poetry.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:56.830
Neglecting the family business

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.070
is indeed unfilial.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.000
But you actually hired an assassin

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.200
to harm me.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:03.550
You've gone too far!

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:04.510
Way too far!

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.790
Lock him in the woodshed.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.220
Starve him for 3...

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:09.690
Two days.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.040
Let him reflect on his actions.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:14.270
Move.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:17.640
Everyone,

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:20.330
I apologize for this embarrassment.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:21.750
What about her?

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.030
The Tang Empire is indeed tolerant
of assassins,

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.510
but those caught in the act

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.010
must still be punished.

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:29.590
If we don't report her to the authorities,

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:30.110
we

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.720
could be accused of harboring a criminal.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.580
Then tie her up.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.130
Bring some rope.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.100
Get the rope

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:36.960
and tie her up.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.310
Wait.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:48.270
I will take her punishment.

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:00.580
Her name isn't Nu Jiao.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:01.550
She is

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:04.720
Jiaonu.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.030
We met in Luoyang.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.920
I was living in the Divine Capital,
preparing for exams,

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.160
but kept failing.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.960
I became depressed

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.200
and spent my days in brothels.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.110
Both of us were lost souls,

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.380
finding comfort in each other

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.680
and accompanying each other

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.210
through the most difficult time
in our lives.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.160
Later, Jiaonu became the top courtesan,

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.990
entertaining officials and nobles daily.

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.550
Once, when I went to see Jiaonu,

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.160
I saw her

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.590
being embraced by a general.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:56.030
Indignant, I stepped forward to rebuke him

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:57.430
and was beaten severely.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:20:59.440
In my anger,

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.310
I took out my frustration on Jiaonu

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:03.600
and swore never to see her again,

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:07.550
even cursing that she would go blind!

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.790
How cruel I was.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:18.790
Looking back now,

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:21.960
it was truly wrong of me.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:26.830
As a songstress, by entertaining guests,

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:29.000
she could earn her freedom sooner,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.350
so we could be together forever.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.510
Afterward...

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.440
Afterward,

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.200
I gained instant recognition

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:43.990
because of my long poem
"Cold Food Ballad."

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.160
I was no longer obsessed
with the imperial exams

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.960
but returned to Nanzhou Prefecture

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.110
to focus on poetry,

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.200
keeping company with other 3 poets

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:54.240
and finding freedom
among mountains and waters.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.550
But in my heart,

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.480
I've always felt guilty toward you.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:08.960
Today,

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.160
let me take the blame for her!

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:15.110
For me,

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:18.440
this is a chance,

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:22.720
an opportunity to make amends.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.240
Nu Jiao.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:31.310
No,

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:33.960
Jiaonu.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.590
Don't you want to say something?

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:39.400
Taking the blame isn't something

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.480
that poet Leng Ji can do

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:43.190
just because he wants to.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.780
Since breaking ties with Leng Ji,

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.100
I've been disheartened.

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:51.090
As a top courtesan,

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.980
3 years of fame was already long enough.

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:56.260
After that, no one cared anymore.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.390
I went from Luoyang to Chang'an

00:22:58.660 --> 00:22:59.860
and was famous for another 2 years.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:00.730
Later on,

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.730
I didn't go to the House of Sorrow
in the Ghost Market,

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:05.420
nor did I marry a merchant.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.630
Instead, I traveled the world.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.090
At Mount Song,

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.490
I met a starving old man.

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:13.900
I gave him a sesame cake,

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:15.220
and he became

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.350
the mentor who taught me martial arts.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.250
Later, I took the name Nu Jiao

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:21.850
and became an assassin.

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:24.290
Remembering Leng Ji's curse

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:25.290
upon me back then,

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:28.550
I pretended to be blind
to hide my identity.

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:34.110
But I've never killed anyone.

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:35.530
Never killed anyone?

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:36.660
Are you possibly

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.030
also an assassin who just takes deposits?

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:39.570
No.

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.090
I don't think so either.

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:42.680
Your skills aren't that poor.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.130
Perhaps you couldn't bring yourself
to do it?

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.380
You had your chance today.

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:56.980
I made a vow

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.940
to only kill the wicked and evil.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:00.710
Today I saw Ruan Daxiong

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:03.090
treating the 3 poets like honored guests.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:04.090
Clearly, he is certainly not

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:05.350
a truly wicked person.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:09.870
Congratulations, Mr. Leng!

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:12.010
What Miss Jiaonu just said

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:14.260
is that she judges whether someone

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:15.090
is good or evil

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:16.980
based on their association with poets.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:17.940
It's clear

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.080
that she has never forgotten you.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.860
I agree. I agree.

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:25.860
So you're saying

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:27.250
these 3 poets

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:28.220
saved my life?

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:32.290
I am deeply grateful.

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.090
As to whether Jiaonu has killed before,

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:36.750
her words alone are not proof.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:38.140
Even though she hasn't,

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.770
she can't escape punishment.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.730
Although the Tang Empire
doesn't ban assassins,

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.860
once there's an assassination attempt,

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.250
it's still treated as premeditated murder.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:47.460
And premeditated murder,

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.590
successful or not, is a serious crime.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:53.180
The county office
will surely impose a heavy sentence.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.380
No! I've already made up my mind:

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.130
If I could reunite with Jiaonu
in this life,

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.700
I would marry her immediately.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.860
This is wonderful news!

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:10.220
In that case,

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.620
Ruan's Restaurant
will host the wedding banquet!

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:13.460
No need.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.010
Yes, yes.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:17.900
We'll marry under the moonlight right now.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.020
What's wrong?

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:32.450
Jiaonu,

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.840
you don't want to marry me?

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:38.090
You won't forgive me?

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.380
Am I going to lose you again?

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:52.290
So be it.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.110
You were caught at the crime scene.

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:58.420
Even though you escape execution,

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:01.900
you'll likely be exiled 3,000 li away.

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:03.860
You'll never return.

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:05.620
I might as well

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:08.290
go ahead of you.

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.880
I'll wait for our wedding
in the underworld.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:26.980
You...

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.730
If we die by the same sword,

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:35.790
we'll recognize each other
in the next life.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.380
Fine.

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:45.300
Mr. Leng, you can't do this.

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:48.090
This won't do. This won't do.

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:48.860
This place

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.460
is my family's ancestral business.

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.050
If you two die here,

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.420
who would dare come to eat here anymore?

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.370
What madness are you talking about?

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.700
If you can die together,
why not live together?

00:26:58.700 --> 00:26:59.460
Nonsense!

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:00.560
Yeah, Mr. Leng.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:01.980
Since you love each other,

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.380
get married tonight.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:04.700
Tomorrow morning,

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.050
you must go to the authorities.

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:07.460
I'm willing to be your guarantor.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.420
If there are accusations
of harboring criminals,

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.380
I will take full responsibility.

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:13.890
Everyone,

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:18.770
are you willing to help make
this beautiful story happen?

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:26.350
I'm just a servant at the Sushan Shop.

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.730
What do you think about this, Boss?

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:32.770
Mr. Su?

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:40.570
Mr. Youbo's words just now—

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.090
"If you can die together,
why not live together?"—

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.050
moved me deeply.

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:48.530
If we're to host a banquet,

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.330
we do have 3

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:51.990
different flavors of sushan.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.750
The banquet is ready.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.220
To welcome the poets,

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.880
I've been preparing for days.

00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:58.700
You see?

00:27:58.730 --> 00:27:59.940
I've always said Mr. Su

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:00.940
is well-educated

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.090
and reasonable.

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:04.290
When we drink together later,

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.250
we should offer

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:06.520
Mr. Su several toasts.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.450
Indeed, indeed.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.920
Let's drink together.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.670
To share a table with you three poets

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.380
is my great honor.

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:16.770
You've all said so much,

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.420
but we should first ask

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.480
Jiaonu's opinion.

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:24.010
Jiaonu.

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:28.010
Shall we get married?

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:31.430
I've been waiting for this day

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:33.940
for so long.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:45.010
After tonight, my Ruan's Restaurant

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.950
will surely go down in history.

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:47.730
At the very least,

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:49.250
it will be recorded

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:50.710
in the books of legends.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.620
The troupe!

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.490
Start playing the music right away!

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.010
Alright!

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.670
We'll get ready right away.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.140
Yes.

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:03.630
[Happiness]

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:19.190
[Happiness]

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:30.460
[Happiness]

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:31.780
The poem goes,

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.820
"While songs ring
through the New Year's wine,

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.010
Flowers dance
the Tang Empire's spring fine."

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.770
Today at Ruan's Restaurant,

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:44.810
distinguished guests fill the seats,
and friends gather like clouds.

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:46.220
Though it's an unexpected day,

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.220
the timing couldn't be better.

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.760
When hearts are filled with love,

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:53.480
every moment becomes auspicious.

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:57.220
Leng Shuye from Nanzhou Prefecture

00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:00.140
and Fu Jiaonu from the northern lands

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:04.420
have endured mountains and waters apart,

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:08.570
and their love blooms
into tonight's joyous wedding.

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.010
Come on, play the music!

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:59.030
Ever heard of the story
of the fake musician?

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.420
I noticed it long ago.

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:04.700
His Majesty loves music.

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.660
Before he entered the Eastern Palace,

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.220
I often accompanied him
in studies, martial arts practice,

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.080
and musical instrument playing.

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:14.510
The ceremony is complete!

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:16.500
Escort them to the bridal chamber!

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:18.180
Great!

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:23.100
Wonderful! Wonderful!

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.250
[Ruan's Restaurant]

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:33.620
I didn't expect to drink wedding wine.

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:35.410
The food at Ruan's Restaurant
is excellent.

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:36.490
Indeed, very good.

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:37.490
Eat.

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:39.600
All you do is eat.

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:41.610
I might just kick both of you.

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:45.930
Leader, they outnumber us.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.470
Since we're so nervous,

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:48.970
let's just leave.

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:50.330
Take that thing

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.990
and get the silver from the exchange shop.

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.530
Silver?

00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:57.830
There's some here too.

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:00.220
Where did it come from?

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:01.660
That owner surnamed Ruan

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.120
is extremely wealthy.

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.620
And he's poetry-obsessed.

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:07.370
Master, your instructions?

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.210
Find a good songstress later

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:13.050
and give her this poem.

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:14.810
When the dancing begins,

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:15.860
have her sing it.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:18.840
This silver ingot will be yours.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.290
That simple?

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:22.290
The poem must be correct.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.390
Not a single word can be wrong.

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:28.860
What's the matter?

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:31.980
Memorize this word for word.

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:33.490
You'll sing it later.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.180
There'll be something in it for you.

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:38.140
Yes.

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:42.050
But there are masters among them.

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:43.620
Especially that Lu guy.

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:46.150
He doesn't look like a servant at all.

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:48.770
He's quite familiar with criminal law.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.040
He might even be

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.620
a constable.

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:56.550
What are you afraid of?

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:59.220
Aren't they going to drink?

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:02.660
Just now, I...

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:21.220
Lu, you promised

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:23.490
to toast us poets with 3 large bowls each.

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:25.140
Yet you switched the wine to water.

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.330
But it finally provoked
the assassin to act.

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:28.590
What a brilliant plan.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:29.220
Indeed.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:33.250
I'm also full of admiration.

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:35.660
We owe thanks to Mr. Su.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.410
But we should make up
for those drinks, right?

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:41.890
Yes, we need to make up for the drinks.

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:43.010
Come on, Mr. Su.

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:45.570
You two are right.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.620
Mr. Leng and his wife
have entered their bridal chamber.

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.330
If we don't drink and celebrate now,

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:51.330
when will we?

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:54.010
No rush.

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:55.900
The sushan is ready.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:57.760
Eat first. After you finish,

00:33:57.810 --> 00:33:59.810
I guarantee you can drink even more.

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:01.380
The sushan is delicious!

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:02.700
Thank you for your hard work, ladies.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.620
Let's all have a bowl together later.

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.420
This is wedding wine, after all.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.030
Thank you, great poet.

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:09.460
This wine smells so good.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.570
I've been smelling it,

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:12.570
and I've been craving it for so long.

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:15.130
Daxiong, let me pour you some.

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:17.190
-Okay. Thank you, Mr. Wang.
-Come on.

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:23.090
Everyone, this sushan goes well with wine.

00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:24.380
The more you drink, the better it gets.

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:26.130
Let's eat the sushan first,

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:28.170
and then drink to our heart's content!

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:29.010
Good, good.

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:48.540
How is it?

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:49.300
Coming.

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:52.210
Drink up.

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:54.750
They've had at least 3 large bowls.

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.380
They're all passed out like logs now.

00:34:58.530 --> 00:34:59.420
Excellent.

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:02.650
Doesn't matter whether they're constables
or not.

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:04.380
They're all as good as dead now.

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:06.050
Liulang, Qilang,

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:07.420
you two guard the first floor.

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:08.620
If anyone comes down,

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:09.980
kill them on sight.

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:12.740
Understood.

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:14.720
If you hear fighting upstairs,

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:16.210
it means the drug didn't completely

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:17.340
knock them out.

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:19.570
You two should come up immediately
to help.

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:20.300
Understood.

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:20.940
Again.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.530
I guess those few

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:03.870
must have gone back to their rooms.

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:04.780
That's fine.

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.470
Let's kill
these two skilled fighters first.

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:21.950
W-What are you going to do?

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:23.930
You snuck upstairs with knives,

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.320
and now you're asking what I'm doing?

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:28.050
You're quite interesting.

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.090
We've fallen into a trap.

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.820
You've finally realized it.

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:33.820
But it's too late.

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:36.340
Kill!

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:38.690
Quickly, take the cabinet and run!

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:39.220
-Go.
-Go.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:42.830
-Go.
-Go.

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:08.460
Why aren't Liulang and Qilang here yet?

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:35.940
Everyone, stand back!

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:53.540
Cover your mouths and noses!

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:12.660
Don't pursue a desperate enemy.

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:19.050
Catch him. Catch him!

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:20.820
After him! After him!

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:22.090
Mr. Gao.

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:23.180
Mr. Wang.

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:24.340
Mr. Ruan.

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.070
What are you doing here?

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:27.570
Didn't I tell you to hide?

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:28.940
And you too, Mr. Leng.

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.210
It's your wedding night.

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:31.340
Why did you come out?

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:33.820
I'll catch the thieves first,

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:35.340
then return to my bride.

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:36.090
Indeed.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.010
As respected poets of the Tang Empire,

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:39.670
how could we simply hide away?

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:41.350
Exactly right.

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:43.530
That's right. We Tang poets

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:44.570
are all skilled in both literature
and martial arts.

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:45.650
We're not to be trifled with.

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:46.490
Well said.

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:48.610
Come here.

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.860
I never expected you to be

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:52.690
the renowned disciple of Master Di,

00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:53.420
Official Lu.

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:55.430
I pay you respect.

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:56.570
I pay you respect as well.

00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:57.300
Official Lu.

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:00.420
I didn't reveal my true identity before

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:01.950
in order to catch the thief.

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:04.380
Please forgive my discourtesy.

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.570
I will interrogate the criminal.

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:09.570
Mr. Leng,
please return to your wedding chamber.

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:11.300
Then I won't stand on ceremony.

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:12.210
Mr. Leng.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:15.090
There's no need for formality
in this matter.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:15.860
Mr. Wang.

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.080
However, Mr. Leng,

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.110
Yingtao must guard your chamber door.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:21.980
After all,

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:24.420
Jiaonu was captured
at the assassination scene.

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:26.340
I am the Yongzhou Judicial Official.

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:27.140
I can't keep an eye on her,

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.780
nor will I allow her to escape.

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.380
You allowed us
to complete our wedding ceremony.

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:33.040
Official Lu, you've shown mercy
beyond the law.

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:35.130
I thank you on behalf of my wife.

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:40.510
-Go.
-Go.

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:49.470
-Go.
-Go.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:51.940
Kneel.

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:55.300
[Wine and Verses]

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:55.900
Sir!

00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:58.180
Sir.

00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:59.610
Those 2 big men from the Xuanhuo Troupe

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:01.410
ran away with the large cabinet.

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:03.780
Those 2 jerks!

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:04.530
[Wine and Verses]

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.220
Stop cursing.

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:07.680
Sai Mengchang,

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.280
what is your real name?

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:09.980
[Gou Mengchang,
Leader of the Xuanhuo Troupe]

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:12.340
My surname is Gou. Gou Mengchang.

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:13.380
[Gou Mengchang, Jianghu Grand Thief]

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.380
The name "Mengchang" isn't made up.

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:17.380
I'm a Judicial Official,
and I'm questioning you.

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:18.820
You must answer truthfully.

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:19.530
Otherwise,

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:21.830
you'll be severely punished
at the county office.

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:23.870
I-I confess.

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:24.690
[Wine and Verses]

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:25.650
Gou Mengchang,

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:27.820
you're not actually

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.230
the leader of the Xuanhuo Troupe, are you?

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:32.340
I'm not.

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:34.690
But those dancestresses and songstresses

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:36.350
belong to the Xuanhuo Troupe.

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:38.380
Lang Yehu has long been

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:39.780
in this business since earlier.

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:40.460
He said,

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:42.690
by using a performance troupe as cover,

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:44.900
it makes it easier
to enter wealthy households

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:45.650
to rob them.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.010
I just fell for his nonsense.

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.420
Seeing you and that woman
were tough to deal with,

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:52.420
we were actually planning to leave.

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:53.260
But...

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:55.420
He...

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:57.610
He's too rich.

00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:58.980
Singing one poem for him

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.580
would earn us a silver ingot.

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:03.570
Running into such a cash cow—

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:05.610
how could we not fleece him?

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:10.260
What a coincidence.

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.210
Ruan Daxiong.

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:12.900
In that case,

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.260
I must definitely include you

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:15.420
in my poetry.

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:16.740
[Wine and Verses]

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:19.510
So you're really not
the leader of the Xuanhuo Troupe.

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:20.980
Where is the real leader then?

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:22.040
Did you kill him?

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:23.060
No, no.

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:24.780
He's in that large cabinet.

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:26.130
The one those 2 jerks

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:27.550
carried away.

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:28.690
All the loot we've scored lately

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:30.530
is in there too.

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:32.200
-My dear...
-Official Lu,

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:34.230
I suggest we hurry after them.

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:35.610
Whether they're desperate bandits or not

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:36.490
isn't important.

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:37.460
The thing is, there's a human life

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:38.460
inside that cabinet.
