00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:03.429
(Episode 29)

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:04.669
What...

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:08.039
What did you want to say?

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:10.299
You took the compatibility test for a liver transplant.

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.239
She might have only looked for you because she needs a match.

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.379
Are you questioning my birth mother?

00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:20.549
You never thought any of this was strange?

00:00:22.049 --> 00:00:23.149
No, I didn't.

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:25.289
Because we met by pure coincidence.

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.129
Diabetes. It's hypoglycaemic shock. Please help me.

00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:35.259
Before I met her as a client,

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.469
we had already met in a way that left no room to doubt her.

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:40.569
- Not me. Oh, there she is. - She asked Su Jeong...

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.999
- That's Eun Oh. - who the portfolio designer was.

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:45.209
- By any chance... - And the subway too.

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.909
I was returning from a client's home,

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:50.639
and she got off the subway first.

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:53.249
If she were following you, she could easily arrange that.

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:55.979
That's ridiculous.

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.649
If she'd found me, she'd have said, "I'm your birth mother."

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.159
How many months has it been since I first met her?

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:05.959
People say it's not a coincidence when it keeps happening.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:08.999
Stop overreacting.

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:10.959
Eun Oh.

00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:13.699
You're too trusting.

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:15.639
You trusted me, didn't you?

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:19.309
You liked me because you saw me as some righteous, upstanding guy.

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:21.809
But was I really that kind of person?

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:23.579
I wasn't, was I?

00:01:25.949 --> 00:01:27.149
That's why I'm telling you to be skeptical.

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.379
It's the liver transplant that I can't get past.

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:39.259
Fine.

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:41.899
That's because you're the calculating one.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.529
Of course, you'd be suspicious.

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.539
She is someone I've come to trust and care for.

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:54.069
Don't you dare talk about her like that.

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:55.839
What?

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:57.379
Her birth...

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:02.249
- She found her birth mother? - I said, drop it.

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:07.249
(Team Manager's Office)

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:22.399
Unbelievable.

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.769
You have to admit that he has a point.

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:33.809
(Director Ko Seong Hui)

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.249
You didn't have to do it,

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:38.449
so thank you so much for getting tested.

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:42.389
Maybe fate brought us together now so I'd have someone to lean on.

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:44.059
See?

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.059
She feels so guilty that she can't even bring herself...

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:49.829
to ask if I actually took the test.

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:57.939
Dad, congratulations.

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:00.209
I hear most people fail it a few times.

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:05.249
I knew he'd pass. When your father sets his mind to it, he's stubborn.

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:07.049
He was a good student, too.

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:11.289
I didn't think an arts major would pass on his first try.

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.919
Come on. I told you I'd pass on the first try, didn't I?

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.129
You sound like you're humble bragging, Dad.

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.359
You should've told me earlier! I would've cooked a special dinner.

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:25.829
That's exactly why I waited until after dinner to say anything.

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.799
Mother. Honey.

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.369
I am now a certified electrical technician.

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.239
I can even get a job with this certification.

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:35.539
I'm home.

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.309
- Hey. - Everyone's here.

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.279
I have something to tell you all...

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.819
Ji Hyuk. Your dad passed his practical exam.

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:42.879
The one that's so hard to pass.

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:45.989
Why are you making such a big deal? Goodness.

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.359
- You passed? - I did.

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.189
I heard the electrician practical was tough to pass on the first try.

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.799
It is. But it all depends on the effort you put in.

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:56.859
Congratulations.

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.729
Yes, thanks.

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.639
I have some news, too.

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:04.769
What is it?

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:06.809
Is something wrong at work?

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:09.879
No, Mom. It's not bad news.

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.379
Dad already knew about this, but...

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.219
I'm acquiring the company, AP.

00:04:17.179 --> 00:04:18.389
An acquisition?

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:22.819
Hey, what are you talking about? Even I've heard of AP.

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:26.759
You're acquiring AP?

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.559
But you said you'd given up on it not too long ago.

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:31.259
I got lucky.

00:04:31.869 --> 00:04:33.729
Ji Hyuk, you didn't say a word all this time...

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:36.539
You knew about this and didn't tell me?

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.539
What was I supposed to say? He's the one who didn't mention it.

00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:45.179
What's all this commotion? Can someone explain what's going on?

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:46.349
Ji Hyuk.

00:04:47.109 --> 00:04:48.149
Is this it?

00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:49.679
Yes.

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:52.319
This is amazing! Grandma,

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.919
it means Ji Hyuk is the president of this company. And it's huge!

00:04:56.989 --> 00:04:58.329
My goodness.

00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:01.129
- What is she talking about? - That's incredible.

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:02.829
I can't believe he acquired AP.

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:05.369
Hey, come on. I'm not telling you this to brag.

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:08.139
This is a huge change for me,

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:12.269
so I wanted to let my family know. I'll have to work my butt off now.

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:15.039
My goodness.

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:22.849
So you're blown away by what Ji Hyuk can do.

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:26.149
You're drinking to calm your nerves and to celebrate.

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:28.289
That's right.

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:32.089
With you breezing through your certification exam too.

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:33.889
How can you two, a father-son duo,

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.059
always skip steps 1 and 2 and jump straight to 3?

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:41.539
That kid didn't just skip steps. He went straight for the prize.

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:43.499
You've got a point.

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:45.239
But still,

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:48.179
on the very day his father passes his practical exam,

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:51.279
he completely steals your thunder with even bigger news.

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:56.119
He said he only had half the investment funds.

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:59.989
Somehow, he persuaded the chairman. Can you believe that?

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:02.789
I think that's pretty incredible in itself.

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:07.559
Sure, I pushed for it myself, but he got rejected at first.

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:09.429
But he pulled off the acquisition.

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:12.369
What that means is, that kid...

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:15.339
pushed it all the way to the final bid.

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:17.469
That's what amazed me.

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:19.839
Honestly, I still can't believe it.

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.479
We liberal arts majors just aren't built that way.

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:27.049
Man, does that take nerve or what?

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:31.719
Come to think of it, I guess I never really...

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:34.149
knew my own son.

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:37.559
You never know what's going on inside your own kid's head.

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:42.659
So from his point of view, seeing me slaving away at my job,

00:06:42.829 --> 00:06:46.329
just struggling to get by on a fixed salary...

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:49.369
I must have looked so pathetic to him.

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:51.369
You're taking it too far, Sang Cheol.

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:56.079
Everyone's built differently. Both then and now,

00:06:56.609 --> 00:06:58.579
we've been hanging on for dear life too, right?

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:03.249
To think a guy that capable ended up in a marriage like that...

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:07.989
But in the end, that too...

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:10.719
I guess that was my fault too.

00:07:20.299 --> 00:07:21.469
It looks like you've had a drink.

00:07:22.499 --> 00:07:23.939
I've had a couple, kid.

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:27.009
- Get some rest. - It was thanks to your advice, Dad.

00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:29.509
You're the one who told me to go see the chairman.

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:32.209
That?

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:33.809
Right. That's why they say...

00:07:34.109 --> 00:07:37.219
it pays to listen to your elders.

00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:39.219
Thank you.

00:07:40.019 --> 00:07:41.559
For helping me see it through without regret.

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:47.129
You think it all worked out just because of something I said?

00:07:47.789 --> 00:07:51.029
Anyway, that was all you. You're the one who did it.

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:06.609
Won't it be too late if you go after Seong Jae finishes work?

00:08:08.549 --> 00:08:11.119
That's why I told Mom I'd be home by 1am or 2am.

00:08:12.149 --> 00:08:14.819
I told Mom I was going with you, so don't forget.

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:16.819
Got it.

00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:21.389
But what if Seong Jae's not into you after your date today?

00:08:23.799 --> 00:08:24.999
He won't be.

00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:27.399
Are you giving up already?

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:29.999
Then why all this trouble today?

00:08:31.369 --> 00:08:32.569
Because I had to do this.

00:08:33.239 --> 00:08:34.339
You wouldn't understand.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:38.479
Nobody understands how I feel.

00:08:41.849 --> 00:08:45.519
- Ji Hyuk, hurry and eat. - You know I don't eat breakfast.

00:08:45.819 --> 00:08:49.159
Ji Hyuk, when's your inauguration? The whole family is going, right?

00:08:49.319 --> 00:08:51.629
I'm not having one. It'll be virtual.

00:08:52.029 --> 00:08:54.829
Hey, why no inauguration? Aren't you the president now?

00:08:54.929 --> 00:08:57.699
I barely managed the acquisition. I don't want to make a fuss.

00:08:58.269 --> 00:08:59.799
First, I need to learn the company inside out.

00:08:59.799 --> 00:09:01.999
- I'm heading out now. - Ji Hyuk.

00:09:02.699 --> 00:09:06.139
We're having a farewell dinner for your grandfather tomorrow.

00:09:06.609 --> 00:09:08.339
Will you be able to make it?

00:09:09.209 --> 00:09:11.749
Of course. It's for Grandfather's send-off.

00:09:12.049 --> 00:09:13.849
Good. That's a relief.

00:09:14.579 --> 00:09:17.279
But I don't think I'll make it home tonight.

00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:18.589
I have a lot of documents to review.

00:09:18.719 --> 00:09:20.889
- I'm off. - Okay.

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:23.089
My goodness.

00:09:23.319 --> 00:09:24.719
Have a good day.

00:09:25.259 --> 00:09:27.459
Why is everyone standing up just because Ji Hyuk is leaving?

00:09:29.059 --> 00:09:30.059
I know, right?

00:09:30.799 --> 00:09:34.129
What do you mean? Ji Hyuk is the CEO now, isn't he?

00:09:34.369 --> 00:09:37.269
I saw on those TV shows. When someone like that leaves,

00:09:37.339 --> 00:09:39.539
the whole family gets up to see them off.

00:09:40.909 --> 00:09:42.539
I really did stand up without thinking.

00:09:43.879 --> 00:09:46.749
- You're all making such a fuss. - Let's eat.

00:09:53.049 --> 00:09:54.249
Mr. Lee. You're here.

00:09:54.549 --> 00:09:57.059
- Have the AP files arrived? - Yes, sir.

00:10:01.089 --> 00:10:02.729
I'm Park Jun Hyeok, head of Strategic Planning.

00:10:03.159 --> 00:10:05.899
- I'm Manager Lee Jeong Hwan. - A pleasure. I'm Lee Ji Hyuk.

00:10:06.799 --> 00:10:09.569
Sir, these are the AP working files you requested.

00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:12.639
Cheol Min. Could you take these to my office?

00:23:13.749 --> 00:23:14.819
Ghostwriter?

00:23:14.889 --> 00:23:19.759
Hey, I'm not going to rip you off. I'll give you all the money, okay?

00:23:22.329 --> 00:23:24.259
I need some time to think about it.

00:23:24.729 --> 00:23:28.029
How long? An hour or two?

00:23:28.129 --> 00:23:29.139
Three hours?

00:23:29.439 --> 00:23:30.439
Four?

00:23:31.239 --> 00:23:33.209
I think I'll need about a day.

00:23:34.539 --> 00:23:37.879
Seriously, you'd be a total fool to miss this chance!

00:23:39.249 --> 00:23:40.579
Can't I even have a day to think?

00:23:41.849 --> 00:23:45.679
Hey, don't bring your car today. And change into something casual.

00:23:45.779 --> 00:23:48.619
- Why do I have to leave my car? - Hey!

00:23:48.689 --> 00:23:49.689
Hey, you startled me!

00:23:51.959 --> 00:23:52.959
And what's with this car?

00:23:53.589 --> 00:23:54.659
Get in.

00:24:04.839 --> 00:24:06.569
Wait, are we going camping?

00:24:06.839 --> 00:24:09.909
You guessed it. Our date today is a camping trip.

00:24:11.579 --> 00:24:13.549
Where are we going? If we leave now, when will we get back?

00:24:13.779 --> 00:24:15.749
I told my mom I'd be home by 2am.

00:24:17.679 --> 00:24:20.089
Camping? Man, there's a first for everything.

00:24:21.019 --> 00:24:23.289
Where did you get all this stuff? Did you buy them?

00:24:23.659 --> 00:24:24.759
I borrowed them from a friend.

00:24:25.019 --> 00:24:26.759
My friend, Ha Jun, is a huge camping fanatic.

00:24:27.359 --> 00:24:29.699
Ha Jun? That sounds like a guy's name.

00:24:29.759 --> 00:24:32.529
Yes. Come on, we're running late. Buckle up.

00:24:32.829 --> 00:24:34.569
- Here we go. - Wait, hang on!

00:24:34.899 --> 00:24:36.099
Are you saying you're going to drive?

00:24:38.869 --> 00:24:40.809
- Let's go. - Hey, wait.

00:24:42.339 --> 00:24:43.339
Here I go.

00:24:50.119 --> 00:24:54.249
Wait, no. Do you even know how to drive?

00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:58.159
I got my license as soon as I became an adult,

00:24:58.159 --> 00:25:00.389
and my big brother was a strict teacher.

00:25:00.959 --> 00:25:02.159
How many years ago was that?

00:25:02.599 --> 00:25:04.359
So you're basically a rusty driver, aren't you?

00:25:04.529 --> 00:25:07.199
I've had a clean driving record for six years.

00:25:08.329 --> 00:25:11.469
Driving opens up more part-time jobs with better pay.

00:25:11.839 --> 00:25:14.409
In college, I drove company cars as a photo shoot assistant...

00:25:14.409 --> 00:25:15.979
and for online shops.

00:25:16.479 --> 00:25:20.149
Wow, a good driver and so resourceful.

00:25:22.049 --> 00:25:24.049
When did the kid with the runny nose grow up so much?

00:25:25.279 --> 00:25:28.649
- Will you forget my runny nose? - Why would I forget that?

00:25:28.919 --> 00:25:30.519
It's such a sweet memory.

00:25:31.259 --> 00:25:32.959
He calls a runny nose a sweet memory.

00:25:33.429 --> 00:25:36.559
If he still sees me that way, then this really is the end.

00:25:37.229 --> 00:25:39.599
No, don't think like that.

00:25:39.899 --> 00:25:42.669
I decided to just enjoy this moment as much as possible.

00:25:44.569 --> 00:25:45.569
Should I put on some upbeat music?

00:25:51.039 --> 00:25:54.279
You act like I've been living under a rock.

00:25:54.979 --> 00:25:57.849
I thought you only ate meat that other people grilled for you.

00:25:59.049 --> 00:26:01.289
Kiddo, I'm friends with your brother, Ji Hyuk.

00:26:01.619 --> 00:26:03.589
Do you think he'd grill anything for me?

00:26:03.589 --> 00:26:05.219
He only ever bossed me around.

00:26:05.289 --> 00:26:06.459
Lee Ji Hyuk, that punk!

00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:09.459
No talking about my oldest brother.

00:26:13.569 --> 00:26:15.069
- Hey. - Yes?

00:26:15.529 --> 00:26:17.699
Look here. One, two, three!

00:26:19.539 --> 00:26:20.539
The obligatory camping photo.

00:26:23.109 --> 00:26:24.139
This is cooked.

00:26:26.679 --> 00:26:27.949
Here, have a bite.

00:26:29.179 --> 00:26:30.219
Here.

00:26:35.289 --> 00:26:36.319
It's delicious.

00:26:37.489 --> 00:26:39.289
Hey. You've got something on your face.

00:26:56.279 --> 00:26:57.279
What?

00:26:57.739 --> 00:26:58.739
Never mind.

00:27:02.449 --> 00:27:03.449
What is it?

00:27:05.349 --> 00:27:07.849
- Is there something on my face? - No.

00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:11.759
Come on! What is it?

00:27:12.289 --> 00:27:13.729
All right. Sorry.

00:27:14.729 --> 00:27:15.759
Let me get it for you.

00:27:16.629 --> 00:27:17.629
There.

00:27:39.989 --> 00:27:40.989
It's burning.

00:27:50.559 --> 00:27:51.559
This is delicious.

00:27:55.769 --> 00:27:56.769
What?

00:27:56.899 --> 00:27:59.569
This is why barbecuing is a must on camping trips.

00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:03.479
You must've gone camping a lot. With your exes?

00:28:03.539 --> 00:28:06.779
No, I mostly went camping with Ha Jun and my friends.

00:28:07.849 --> 00:28:11.849
But you know what the best part of camping really is?

00:28:26.129 --> 00:28:28.169
I've never seen that look on her face before.

00:28:29.899 --> 00:28:30.899
Done.

00:28:32.569 --> 00:28:33.569
Here, Seong Jae.

00:28:35.709 --> 00:28:38.479
Look at you, working so hard to feed this amateur.

00:28:44.649 --> 00:28:45.649
How is it?

00:28:47.789 --> 00:28:50.319
Wow, this is so sweet! Delicious!

00:28:50.319 --> 00:28:51.619
- I know, right? - Yes.

00:28:57.159 --> 00:29:00.929
This must be a first for Chief Director Park Seong Jae.

00:29:01.899 --> 00:29:03.069
That's true.

00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:07.139
By the way, I'm no longer the Chief Director.

00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:09.039
I was promoted to Vice President.

00:29:10.179 --> 00:29:12.809
- Vice President? - It's just a title.

00:29:14.049 --> 00:29:16.919
Why are you just telling me now? I would've bought you a cake.

00:29:17.779 --> 00:29:19.589
It's not really something to celebrate.

00:29:20.949 --> 00:29:21.949
Why not?

00:29:22.619 --> 00:29:25.389
Life is pretty cruel.

00:29:26.289 --> 00:29:29.499
When I had a goal and craved power, I was just a Chief Director.

00:29:30.099 --> 00:29:32.629
But now that I've lost that goal, I'm the VP.

00:29:34.029 --> 00:29:35.529
What do you mean?

00:29:36.129 --> 00:29:38.969
There's already someone I like. I've liked her for a long time.

00:29:39.739 --> 00:29:41.339
Is he talking about her?

00:29:41.839 --> 00:29:43.939
Does he still like her?

00:29:45.209 --> 00:29:47.209
So you're unhappy about the promotion?

00:29:48.709 --> 00:29:50.019
I wouldn't say that.

00:29:50.719 --> 00:29:52.919
Somewhere along the way, work actually became pretty fun.

00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:05.129
It's raining.

00:30:05.429 --> 00:30:09.169
Oh, seriously? It's raining? Hey, get up.

00:30:16.109 --> 00:30:18.039
We're really doing it all today.

00:30:18.309 --> 00:30:20.179
Staring into the fire, and now staring at the rain.

00:30:21.949 --> 00:30:23.319
The rain is so beautiful.

00:30:31.919 --> 00:30:33.259
So, tell me.

00:30:34.159 --> 00:30:36.999
Jinhwa Group wants to organise an engagement ceremony.

00:30:37.999 --> 00:30:39.229
That's huge news, isn't it?

00:30:40.099 --> 00:30:41.529
What? Already?

00:30:42.329 --> 00:30:46.369
- Yeong Ra. Were you going so fast? - No...

00:30:46.439 --> 00:30:49.339
You know how kids are these days.

00:30:49.539 --> 00:30:52.309
You act like it's still our generation.

00:30:53.049 --> 00:30:57.749
No, it's just... I never thought she would fall in love so fast.

00:30:58.249 --> 00:30:59.279
Yeong Ra.

00:31:02.219 --> 00:31:04.389
Stop. You're embarrassing her.

00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:05.889
If she's so embarrassed,

00:31:05.889 --> 00:31:07.389
why the talk of an engagement already?

00:31:08.029 --> 00:31:11.859
- My goodness. - It's with Jinhwa Pharmaceuticals.

00:31:13.229 --> 00:31:17.339
The Jinhwa family is more than a good enough match for Yeong Ra.

00:31:19.469 --> 00:31:21.739
I wanted Seong Jae to marry first,

00:31:21.739 --> 00:31:23.739
but you're in love, so what can I do?

00:31:25.139 --> 00:31:27.809
So, when are they suggesting for the engagement ceremony?

00:31:31.919 --> 00:31:33.719
Oh, what do I do?

00:31:41.929 --> 00:31:43.799
(Manager Lee Ji Wan)

00:31:48.229 --> 00:31:50.169
It's no use telling Ji Wan about this.

00:31:52.199 --> 00:31:54.309
Gosh, what do I do?

00:32:01.209 --> 00:32:04.679
- Back up your car! - This is Inspector Nam.

00:32:04.949 --> 00:32:06.019
Yes, I'm here now...

00:32:06.019 --> 00:32:08.289
There's a landslide up ahead. You can't get through.

00:32:08.349 --> 00:32:11.359
- Move your cars back. - Yes, requesting equipment backup.

00:32:13.959 --> 00:32:16.129
- Yes. - Hi, there's been a landslide.

00:32:16.129 --> 00:32:17.559
You can't get through up ahead.

00:32:18.259 --> 00:32:19.429
But isn't there another way?

00:32:19.529 --> 00:32:24.099
No, this is the only road in or out. It won't be cleared until morning.

00:32:25.869 --> 00:32:27.339
I see. Thank you.

00:32:27.409 --> 00:32:29.039
- Sorry about that. - Yes, okay.

00:32:29.109 --> 00:32:30.279
You'll have to back your car up.

00:32:31.739 --> 00:32:33.779
Oh, man. What are we going to do?

00:32:34.249 --> 00:32:37.049
I'm so sorry. You have to work tomorrow.

00:32:37.979 --> 00:32:39.119
Should we try walking?

00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:44.289
In this heavy rain?

00:32:46.859 --> 00:32:48.829
Well, grab on.

00:32:55.999 --> 00:32:58.869
Su Bin, we're low on gas,

00:32:59.039 --> 00:33:00.369
so we can't run the heater all night.

00:33:02.339 --> 00:33:05.139
You're right. I meant to fill up on the way home.

00:33:05.279 --> 00:33:06.409
I'm so sorry.

00:33:07.109 --> 00:33:11.119
Hey, it's not your fault. We'd have gas without the accident.

00:33:12.119 --> 00:33:13.889
Just cover up with that blanket and get some sleep.

00:33:15.119 --> 00:33:18.859
- What about you? - I'll be fine. Go on, sleep.

00:33:19.119 --> 00:33:21.189
Roll up the window. It's getting cold.

00:33:26.499 --> 00:33:27.829
Come on, roll it up. Hurry.

00:33:28.929 --> 00:33:31.469
All the way up.

00:33:54.789 --> 00:33:55.929
Gosh, my leg.

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:27.389
You must be cold.

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:32.099
- No, forget it. You'll be cold. - Don't worry. I'm fine.

00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:33.799
The cold doesn't bother me anyway.

00:34:35.529 --> 00:34:38.539
Then at least sleep back here. There's plenty of room.

00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:45.939
No, I'm fine.

00:34:48.849 --> 00:34:50.279
I'm not trying to make a move on you.

00:34:51.849 --> 00:34:55.849
- I meant we could share warmth. - No, I...

00:34:57.859 --> 00:34:59.019
Just go to sleep.

00:35:20.409 --> 00:35:22.049
I'm sorry.

00:35:22.509 --> 00:35:24.349
For bringing you all the way out here.

00:35:26.989 --> 00:35:29.089
But why aren't you even mad?

00:35:30.889 --> 00:35:34.289
What's there to be mad about? I actually had fun.

00:35:37.099 --> 00:35:38.259
Really?

00:35:38.799 --> 00:35:40.199
Going through all this trouble?

00:35:42.269 --> 00:35:43.339
You'd think so.

00:35:44.169 --> 00:35:47.109
When I'm with you, all sorts of crazy things happen.

00:35:48.469 --> 00:35:50.009
You're a total troublemaker.

00:37:20.499 --> 00:37:21.499
It's warm.

00:38:20.759 --> 00:38:21.759
This is...

00:38:23.129 --> 00:38:24.259
I mean...

00:38:31.039 --> 00:38:32.339
Oh, well...

00:38:32.969 --> 00:38:33.969
What time is it?

00:38:35.839 --> 00:38:37.239
I'm just going to step out for a minute.

00:38:56.729 --> 00:38:58.199
It was so warm.

00:39:00.269 --> 00:39:02.299
Su Bin. Let's get going.

00:39:02.829 --> 00:39:04.299
- What? - We can get out of here now.

00:39:04.639 --> 00:39:07.109
Let's go. Grab your stuff. Come on.

00:39:08.009 --> 00:39:09.009
- Okay. - Come on.

00:39:15.379 --> 00:39:18.279
Su Bin, what time does your mom usually get up?

00:39:18.679 --> 00:39:20.889
- Around 7am? - At 7am?

00:39:22.119 --> 00:39:24.259
Shoot, we have to get there before then.

00:39:25.689 --> 00:39:27.489
Hey, slow down a bit.

00:39:27.659 --> 00:39:30.729
No, I can't. I'm dead if Ji Hyuk catches us.

00:39:51.849 --> 00:39:52.979
Okay, get out. Quick.

00:40:01.289 --> 00:40:02.729
You can sneak in without getting caught, right?

00:40:09.929 --> 00:40:10.939
What about the car?

00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:13.069
I'll leave it in the public lot.

00:40:13.469 --> 00:40:14.669
I'll leave the key on top of the back tire.

00:40:15.839 --> 00:40:16.839
Hurry and get inside.

00:40:17.409 --> 00:40:18.409
Wait.

00:40:21.209 --> 00:40:22.209
What?

00:40:24.119 --> 00:40:25.919
This was our third date.

00:40:29.219 --> 00:40:31.459
So, what's your answer?

00:40:34.329 --> 00:40:35.329
Oh, that...

00:40:39.099 --> 00:40:40.969
What do you think? It's a no, obviously.

00:40:47.469 --> 00:40:49.769
Look, I told you before. Nothing's changed.

00:40:51.739 --> 00:40:55.409
Still, it was fun while it lasted, Lee Su Bin.

00:40:56.679 --> 00:40:57.679
All right.

00:40:59.319 --> 00:41:02.119
Hurry inside. If Ji Hyuk wakes up, things will get messy.

00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:04.889
Is that what you're so worried about?

00:41:05.919 --> 00:41:07.029
Don't worry.

00:41:07.389 --> 00:41:10.089
Even if I get caught, I won't say I spent the night with you.

00:41:10.629 --> 00:41:11.829
I wouldn't tell them if my life depended on it.

00:41:12.229 --> 00:41:13.229
So don't you worry.

00:41:17.569 --> 00:41:18.569
Right.

00:41:19.869 --> 00:41:20.869
Go on inside.

00:41:59.209 --> 00:42:01.809
Fine, I get it. I'll forget about it.

00:42:02.549 --> 00:42:03.879
If you're that sure it's a no,

00:42:04.519 --> 00:42:06.719
I won't push it anymore.

00:42:20.469 --> 00:42:21.969
I got in safe and sound without getting caught.

00:42:24.739 --> 00:42:26.499
Gosh, what a terrible way to end things.

00:42:33.079 --> 00:42:34.079
Su Bin.

00:42:34.809 --> 00:42:37.719
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

00:42:39.319 --> 00:42:40.319
I really mean it.

00:42:41.989 --> 00:42:44.389
But after we started dating, I realised something.

00:42:45.419 --> 00:42:46.419
You're...

00:42:47.259 --> 00:42:48.789
You're way too good for me.

00:42:50.459 --> 00:42:52.259
My family is the textbook example of a dysfunctional rich family.

00:42:52.929 --> 00:42:55.099
I can't even date or marry who I want.

00:42:56.369 --> 00:42:58.539
If my father even found out that you dated me,

00:42:59.439 --> 00:43:02.539
he's the type who would go on an absolute rampage.

00:43:03.309 --> 00:43:05.179
I don't want you to get hurt like that.

00:43:05.979 --> 00:43:09.349
I want you to meet a great guy and stay as cheerful as you are now.

00:43:09.909 --> 00:43:11.749
That's what I wanted to say.

00:43:13.449 --> 00:43:15.049
I wanted to let her go on good terms.

00:43:16.549 --> 00:43:18.419
But instead, I pushed her away without any real closure...

00:43:19.189 --> 00:43:20.189
and rushed her out.

00:43:44.679 --> 00:43:46.719
- My goodness! - Oh, gosh!

00:43:47.689 --> 00:43:50.149
So, choose. Is it me or Ji Eun Oh?

00:43:51.819 --> 00:43:52.819
It's Eun Oh.

00:43:53.929 --> 00:43:54.989
My daughter.

00:43:56.059 --> 00:43:57.059
Your big sister.

00:44:00.259 --> 00:44:01.269
I can't.

00:44:02.699 --> 00:44:03.769
I just can't do it.

00:44:09.139 --> 00:44:10.139
I'm sorry.

00:44:11.779 --> 00:44:12.939
I'm so sorry, but...

00:44:15.379 --> 00:44:17.119
I can't go through with the liver transplant.

00:44:26.889 --> 00:44:27.889
A surprise party?

00:44:29.229 --> 00:44:31.399
Do you think Eun Oh would accept if she knew it was from me?

00:44:31.959 --> 00:44:34.399
That's true, but...

00:44:34.469 --> 00:44:37.099
Do you think Eun Oh's in the mood for that?

00:44:37.599 --> 00:44:38.939
That's all the more reason we have to do it.

00:44:39.369 --> 00:44:41.539
Eun Oh has spent her whole life thinking tomorrow is her birthday.

00:44:41.869 --> 00:44:43.039
We have to remind her of that.

00:44:43.939 --> 00:44:46.179
"Ji Eun Oh, your current mother is your real mom."

00:44:46.539 --> 00:44:47.649
"Your birthday is tomorrow."

00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:51.279
We have to make her forget about the transplant.

00:44:52.549 --> 00:44:53.989
You're right. Absolutely.

00:44:54.849 --> 00:44:56.489
That's a brilliant idea.

00:44:57.589 --> 00:45:00.629
- Really? Okay, great. - Okay.

00:45:03.629 --> 00:45:05.329
I don't believe that's a good idea.

00:45:06.529 --> 00:45:07.529
What? Excuse me?

00:45:08.869 --> 00:45:09.969
Cheol Min.

00:45:13.739 --> 00:45:14.739
Cheol Min.

00:45:16.609 --> 00:45:19.109
What did you say? You don't think it's a good idea?

00:45:20.079 --> 00:45:24.249
- That's right. - Cheol Min, you're capable, but...

00:45:24.479 --> 00:45:26.249
Do you know you have a knack for getting under people's skin?

00:45:27.519 --> 00:45:28.519
I do?

00:45:30.249 --> 00:45:32.389
You look like you've just returned from a race for love.

00:45:32.719 --> 00:45:35.489
What the... Are you stalking me or something?

00:45:35.759 --> 00:45:37.159
Or do you have a bad habit of jumping to conclusions?

00:45:38.929 --> 00:45:39.959
With your resume,

00:45:40.399 --> 00:45:42.869
- it was strange you joined us. - No, sir.

00:45:43.729 --> 00:45:45.339
I'm not a strange person, Mr. Lee.

00:45:45.969 --> 00:45:48.269
I have merely...

00:45:48.739 --> 00:45:51.609
inherited blood that's just different from others.

00:45:51.939 --> 00:45:52.939
Now, you're being even weirder.

00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:59.319
I'm about to tell you something. But my telling you this...

00:46:00.119 --> 00:46:02.119
cannot be used as grounds for my dismissal.

00:46:06.189 --> 00:46:08.289
This place is a perfect match for me.

00:46:08.559 --> 00:46:10.799
This company is going to succeed, and my salary will go up.

00:46:10.899 --> 00:46:12.299
I have no intention of ever quitting.

00:46:14.129 --> 00:46:15.429
Would you listen to this guy? What?

00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:18.469
Even the way you're talking now is bizarre.

00:46:19.769 --> 00:46:20.769
That is because I...

00:46:24.139 --> 00:46:26.679
I come from a long line of male shamans.

00:46:28.349 --> 00:46:31.019
- You were a shaman? - No, absolutely not.

00:46:32.249 --> 00:46:34.819
Thanks to my grandfather's prayers, I avoided divine possession,

00:46:36.149 --> 00:46:37.459
and I just have to live a quiet life.

00:46:38.689 --> 00:46:40.859
- But you're not quiet, are you? - That's...

00:46:43.559 --> 00:46:46.159
some foresight that just appears around people I get good vibes from.

00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:49.929
That's what you could call it.

00:46:51.139 --> 00:46:52.669
Seriously? A guy with foresight...

00:46:52.939 --> 00:46:54.769
is telling me a birthday party is a bad idea?

00:46:56.169 --> 00:46:57.909
You're good at your job, so I can't even fire you.

00:46:58.639 --> 00:47:01.009
Just watch what you say around the office.

00:47:02.449 --> 00:47:03.449
You may go.

00:47:09.619 --> 00:47:10.619
(CEO's Office)

00:47:12.989 --> 00:47:15.189
He really shouldn't throw her a birthday party tomorrow.

00:47:21.699 --> 00:47:23.939
- Mother, can you taste this for me? - Sure.

00:47:29.709 --> 00:47:32.209
The braised ribs came out great.

00:47:33.579 --> 00:47:36.379
My father loved spicy braised ribs more than anything.

00:47:37.979 --> 00:47:41.089
But I rarely made it for him, even just a few times a year.

00:47:42.249 --> 00:47:43.819
That's how it is for everyone.

00:47:44.389 --> 00:47:48.529
Everyone has regrets when their parents are gone.

00:47:48.689 --> 00:47:51.759
After I got married, until the day my father passed away,

00:47:52.059 --> 00:47:53.529
I didn't even get to visit him ten times.

00:47:54.469 --> 00:47:58.599
I was busy caring for my husband, since he was always sick or hurt.

00:48:00.399 --> 00:48:02.469
You must have had a lot of regrets too.

00:48:03.909 --> 00:48:04.979
These braised ribs...

00:48:05.709 --> 00:48:08.409
What's it called? Right, "recipe."

00:48:08.409 --> 00:48:10.109
Write it down and give it to your sister-in-law.

00:48:11.119 --> 00:48:13.049
But it's not the same as making it for him myself.

00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:15.589
That's what I'm saying.

00:48:16.189 --> 00:48:19.119
Everyone feels their own loss the most.

00:48:21.459 --> 00:48:24.129
Mother, why are you being so philosophical today?

00:48:24.199 --> 00:48:25.199
That's me, the wise sage!

00:48:25.959 --> 00:48:27.399
How can you be laughing right now?

00:48:28.769 --> 00:48:31.739
Your mother has me crying one moment and laughing the next.

00:48:32.369 --> 00:48:34.339
- I'm home. - He's here.

00:48:34.409 --> 00:48:36.339
- He's here. - I ran into Grandpa on the way,

00:48:36.339 --> 00:48:37.639
- Yes. - so we came together.

00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:42.349
Hey.

00:48:42.779 --> 00:48:46.549
Mom, have a drink too. You can handle one beer, can't you?

00:48:47.279 --> 00:48:48.819
What? One beer?

00:48:49.319 --> 00:48:51.689
My goodness, these kids have no idea what their mother can handle.

00:48:52.959 --> 00:48:55.129
Back when this guy was courting her,

00:48:55.759 --> 00:48:58.529
she came home passed out on his back several times.

00:48:59.599 --> 00:49:00.769
Dad!

00:49:02.029 --> 00:49:04.969
I was about ready to kill Sang Cheol.

00:49:05.539 --> 00:49:09.409
How dare that punk even think about doing that to my precious daughter?

00:49:09.469 --> 00:49:12.109
Father, it's not like I forced her to drink.

00:49:12.279 --> 00:49:14.449
We got into an argument. Then she got all worked up...

00:49:14.449 --> 00:49:16.649
and just started chugging drink after drink.

00:49:17.549 --> 00:49:18.849
Mom, you were chugging drinks?

00:49:19.949 --> 00:49:22.049
Grandpa, I guess Mom was a bit of a rebel.

00:49:22.419 --> 00:49:25.359
My goodness, is there any child who's never rebellious?

00:49:25.719 --> 00:49:27.359
There's no such thing in this world.

00:49:28.359 --> 00:49:30.529
But still, when it comes to Da Jeong,

00:49:30.729 --> 00:49:33.699
I'm just grateful she's my daughter.

00:49:35.169 --> 00:49:36.169
Dad.

00:49:37.739 --> 00:49:40.469
And for my part, being Sang Cheol's mother...

00:49:41.339 --> 00:49:42.539
has been a true joy.

00:49:44.079 --> 00:49:46.809
What? You're going to make me cry.

00:49:47.509 --> 00:49:49.249
Do moms and dads really think like this?

00:49:51.579 --> 00:49:52.579
Father.

00:49:53.479 --> 00:49:54.719
Once I'm back on my feet,

00:49:55.549 --> 00:49:56.889
with Da Jeong by my side,

00:49:57.219 --> 00:50:00.119
I'll come visit you with some ice-cold makgeolli.

00:50:01.689 --> 00:50:03.559
All right, you do that.

00:50:04.259 --> 00:50:06.459
Hey, our makgeolli is getting warm.

00:50:06.759 --> 00:50:08.829
- Let's have a toast first. - Okay.

00:50:08.899 --> 00:50:11.169
- Grandpa, you do the honours. - Yes.

00:50:11.169 --> 00:50:13.139
- All right. - Here.

00:50:13.139 --> 00:50:15.769
Here's to all of us, and for everything!

00:50:15.909 --> 00:50:18.109
- Cheers! - Cheers!

00:50:28.719 --> 00:50:30.189
My, this is the life.

00:50:35.089 --> 00:50:38.829
- Happy birthday, dear Eun Oh - Happy birthday, dear Eun Oh

00:50:39.099 --> 00:50:42.269
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

00:50:51.039 --> 00:50:53.379
Seriously, Mom, what is all this?

00:50:53.939 --> 00:50:56.679
Rice cake balls, shrimp tempura, and even lasagna.

00:50:57.279 --> 00:50:58.849
Dumplings, tteokbokki...

00:50:59.549 --> 00:51:02.319
This is all the stuff she used to make for your birthday parties.

00:51:02.389 --> 00:51:03.389
Your favourites.

00:51:04.089 --> 00:51:07.159
Yes. It made me super popular with all my friends.

00:51:08.129 --> 00:51:11.699
But why make all these dishes from back then all of a sudden?

00:51:11.759 --> 00:51:13.229
And why go all out like this?

00:51:14.229 --> 00:51:15.999
Because I don't know when you might leave.

00:51:18.539 --> 00:51:20.499
What's that supposed to mean?

00:51:20.969 --> 00:51:23.809
You said you were thinking of getting married, remember?

00:51:25.039 --> 00:51:26.309
Even if it's not marriage,

00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:29.209
I know all kids eventually leave the nest.

00:51:30.509 --> 00:51:32.879
But Mom, are you crying just thinking of it?

00:51:33.249 --> 00:51:34.319
I guess I am.

00:51:37.289 --> 00:51:40.889
I'll still be in Korea. It's not like I'm actually leaving.

00:51:41.129 --> 00:51:42.129
So, can I eat now?

00:51:43.089 --> 00:51:46.899
Yes, of course. Go ahead and eat. Eun Oh, you should eat too. Eat up.

00:51:56.769 --> 00:51:58.509
Ta-da!

00:51:59.809 --> 00:52:03.279
Mom, what's all this?

00:52:03.579 --> 00:52:04.779
They're your birthday presents.

00:52:06.179 --> 00:52:07.179
Go on. Open them.

00:52:08.289 --> 00:52:09.619
These all look like designer brands.

00:52:10.449 --> 00:52:11.789
Hurry up and open them!

00:52:25.139 --> 00:52:26.139
Mom.

00:52:26.739 --> 00:52:30.009
I bought them with the Recipe Reward I got from HQ.

00:52:31.209 --> 00:52:33.709
I've never been able to buy you anything nice before.

00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:39.119
Mom, why are you being like this? I don't need any of this.

00:52:41.419 --> 00:52:43.189
Give me the receipts. I'm going to return them.

00:52:44.619 --> 00:52:45.889
Why would you return them?

00:52:46.619 --> 00:52:48.959
What? Are you trying to make a fool of me?

00:52:49.729 --> 00:52:52.799
I bought these with the money I earned from my recipe.

00:52:52.799 --> 00:52:54.629
What right do you have to return these?

00:52:55.429 --> 00:52:58.769
It's my first time giving you a proper gift as an adult.

00:53:00.569 --> 00:53:03.469
Mom, before Dad's business failed,

00:53:03.709 --> 00:53:08.109
I always wore the prettiest clothes and the nicest shoes in my class.

00:53:08.479 --> 00:53:10.409
You bought me so many things.

00:53:10.849 --> 00:53:12.649
And when was that?

00:53:13.149 --> 00:53:15.549
That was only until you were a freshman in high school.

00:53:16.289 --> 00:53:18.719
I got you nothing in your 20s, when you were at your prettiest.

00:53:18.989 --> 00:53:22.489
You scrimped and saved to help the family.

00:53:22.889 --> 00:53:24.699
And you even used your money to help me open my restaurant.

00:53:27.669 --> 00:53:30.729
But Mom, I really don't need any of this.

00:53:31.769 --> 00:53:33.599
Why do you equate expensive with good?

00:53:34.609 --> 00:53:37.139
Don't you have more faith in your own daughter?

00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:52.089
You raised me well, so I can make any clothes look good.

00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:55.529
I could wear anything,

00:53:55.889 --> 00:53:58.199
and my friends would always ask if I got it from a department store.

00:54:01.029 --> 00:54:02.499
"Because you raised me well," she says.

00:54:03.699 --> 00:54:05.069
And I didn't give birth to her.

00:54:11.539 --> 00:54:13.539
Mom, are you crying?

00:54:13.939 --> 00:54:14.949
No.

00:54:15.809 --> 00:54:20.619
The tears just well up sometimes. That's menopause for you.

00:54:22.319 --> 00:54:26.889
Oh, dear. What am I going to do with you?

00:54:30.129 --> 00:54:32.129
(Mom's Car)

00:54:33.029 --> 00:54:34.029
What do you want for lunch?

00:54:35.929 --> 00:54:37.229
You're still staring at that?

00:54:39.899 --> 00:54:42.939
Hey, isn't it your parents' anniversary today?

00:54:43.669 --> 00:54:45.509
I guess that's why she's been home all day.

00:54:45.839 --> 00:54:47.479
That's right.

00:54:47.979 --> 00:54:48.979
You've got a lot on your mind.

00:54:51.179 --> 00:54:54.279
But why do you keep checking Director Ko's location?

00:54:55.519 --> 00:54:56.519
Is something bothering you?

00:54:58.719 --> 00:55:00.619
- It's nothing. - It's clearly not nothing.

00:55:01.059 --> 00:55:03.329
You're clearly worried. Come on, tell me.

00:55:04.399 --> 00:55:07.159
There's no point in telling you. I already know what you'll say.

00:55:07.299 --> 00:55:10.529
Why? Did she set a wedding date for you or something?

00:55:11.299 --> 00:55:15.469
What? Why would you even bring up marriage?

00:55:16.469 --> 00:55:20.039
Then what's wrong?

00:55:20.879 --> 00:55:23.879
Do you really think Director Ko is having an affair?

00:55:26.979 --> 00:55:28.289
That's part of it, but...

00:55:29.389 --> 00:55:30.549
I don't really know.

00:55:31.389 --> 00:55:33.319
I just feel like I need to know...

00:55:33.959 --> 00:55:35.359
what my mom is doing...

00:55:36.689 --> 00:55:37.899
and what she's up to.

00:55:45.039 --> 00:55:46.769
Still no word from her.

00:55:47.669 --> 00:55:49.669
You're making things difficult, Eun Oh.

00:56:00.679 --> 00:56:03.089
I told you we should at least go to Singapore this year.

00:56:03.549 --> 00:56:07.889
With our kids' situation, no. Once the kids are settled,

00:56:08.189 --> 00:56:11.059
you can take me on a cruise without a care in the world.

00:56:11.129 --> 00:56:12.129
All right.

00:56:12.799 --> 00:56:13.799
How about for our 30th anniversary?

00:56:14.529 --> 00:56:17.029
You should look forward to it. Our 30th will be the real deal.

00:56:18.739 --> 00:56:19.899
For our tenth anniversary,

00:56:19.899 --> 00:56:21.539
you got me that apartment in Apgujeong,

00:56:21.669 --> 00:56:23.909
and for our 20th, the building in Sinsa-dong.

00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:25.409
Honey, after all that...

00:56:25.409 --> 00:56:28.749
You're setting my expectations high by telling me to look forward to it.

00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:30.509
Set them as high as you want.

00:56:32.579 --> 00:56:36.119
What's the point? You just donate all the money you make from them...

00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:37.989
instead of spending it on yourself.

00:56:38.859 --> 00:56:41.989
But on my birthday, our anniversary, and every Christmas...

00:56:42.059 --> 00:56:46.159
Do you know how much jewellery and how many handbags you've bought me?

00:56:46.359 --> 00:56:48.499
You've made it so I don't have to buy anything for myself.

00:56:50.299 --> 00:56:52.539
But for women, isn't more better?

00:56:52.539 --> 00:56:55.139
I've heard some even have designer bags in every colour.

00:56:55.869 --> 00:56:58.109
A bag is just a bag.

00:56:58.479 --> 00:57:02.409
If your bag costs a fortune, is it filled with happiness too?

00:57:03.079 --> 00:57:05.449
It's so hard to find happiness as it is.

00:57:10.119 --> 00:57:11.189
(Ms. Shin)

00:57:11.289 --> 00:57:12.919
Ji Eun Oh hasn't left the office yet.

00:57:15.389 --> 00:57:17.759
Ji Eun Oh is really starting to get on my nerves.

00:57:33.739 --> 00:57:35.009
Is anyone here?

00:57:36.579 --> 00:57:37.979
I think a fuse blew.

00:57:41.389 --> 00:57:42.489
Did everyone go home?

00:57:50.959 --> 00:57:54.199
- Happy birthday to you - To you

00:57:54.729 --> 00:57:58.099
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

00:57:58.369 --> 00:58:02.169
Happy birthday, dear Eun Oh

00:58:02.239 --> 00:58:05.879
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

00:58:06.939 --> 00:58:08.009
Happy birthday.

00:58:10.349 --> 00:58:11.479
Make a wish and blow out the candles.

00:58:22.859 --> 00:58:26.299
- What are you doing at the office? - It's an employee perk.

00:58:26.799 --> 00:58:28.829
Starting today, birthday cakes are on the company.

00:58:37.269 --> 00:58:40.009
Ji Eun Oh is having a birthday party at the office.

00:58:40.909 --> 00:58:44.279
So she's having a birthday party at the office?

00:58:50.349 --> 00:58:52.189
- Honey. - Yes.

00:58:59.559 --> 00:59:00.959
This wine is really good tonight.

00:59:04.899 --> 00:59:06.299
Why the sudden rush?

00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:11.139
You.

00:59:12.639 --> 00:59:14.679
An employee is going in with some alcohol.

00:59:15.649 --> 00:59:17.679
So, you're going to have some fun on your birthday?

00:59:18.719 --> 00:59:20.319
I bet you're going to have a few drinks.

00:59:21.319 --> 00:59:23.419
I just feel like drinking tonight.

00:59:25.019 --> 00:59:26.019
How much?

00:59:32.359 --> 00:59:35.029
Honey. Tonight, let's...

00:59:35.799 --> 00:59:39.669
- drink this wine like soju. - What's gotten into you?

00:59:40.769 --> 00:59:42.169
This wine is just so good tonight.

00:59:43.769 --> 00:59:44.779
It is, isn't it?

00:59:45.039 --> 00:59:47.609
I'm usually a lightweight with wine, but this is going down so smoothly.

00:59:49.509 --> 00:59:51.449
- Bottoms up. - What?

00:59:53.179 --> 00:59:55.519
I love how you can be so unpredictable.

01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:01.789
Bottoms up.

01:00:08.929 --> 01:00:09.929
Oh, dear.

01:00:12.369 --> 01:00:14.569
It's okay. You can go. I won't need anything else.

01:01:43.689 --> 01:01:44.799
Director Ko?

01:01:51.769 --> 01:01:54.169
Is something wrong?

01:02:03.679 --> 01:02:04.679
Yu Ra.

01:02:05.749 --> 01:02:06.879
I can't bring myself...

01:02:08.019 --> 01:02:09.789
to ask you to be a liver donor.

01:02:11.989 --> 01:02:12.989
But...

01:02:14.019 --> 01:02:15.959
I can't just let my son die either.

01:02:18.459 --> 01:02:20.529
Why did you have to be a match?

01:02:21.329 --> 01:02:23.399
Why did we have to meet at a time like this?

01:02:25.839 --> 01:02:27.039
Why did I...

01:02:28.139 --> 01:02:30.709
tell you that your birth parents might be missing you?

01:02:32.379 --> 01:02:33.709
If it weren't for me,

01:02:35.009 --> 01:02:37.009
you wouldn't be going through all this pain.

01:02:42.919 --> 01:02:44.019
But still...

01:02:45.389 --> 01:02:47.059
If you save your brother,

01:02:48.559 --> 01:02:50.829
the three of us can make up for all the lost time.

01:02:51.389 --> 01:02:52.659
Let's live together.

01:02:54.329 --> 01:02:55.769
What else matters?

01:02:57.499 --> 01:02:58.899
I'll walk away from everything.

01:03:03.209 --> 01:03:04.469
Come live with me, Eun Oh.

01:03:53.019 --> 01:03:55.959
(Our Golden Days)

01:03:56.089 --> 01:03:57.689
Have you been out working somewhere?

01:03:57.759 --> 01:04:00.029
Quit right now. How much money do you need?

01:04:00.099 --> 01:04:02.429
- I'll cover it all. - You want us to tail someone?

01:04:02.499 --> 01:04:04.969
No way... Is my mom pregnant?

01:04:05.339 --> 01:04:07.069
Becoming the Chairman of Shoe Joy.

01:04:07.339 --> 01:04:10.169
That's your duty and how you can repay me.

01:04:10.409 --> 01:04:13.079
Eun Oh, please, you can't do this. This is just wrong.

01:04:13.139 --> 01:04:14.679
You came to steal my Eun Oh's liver, didn't you?

01:04:15.049 --> 01:04:16.609
You're a monster!

01:04:17.049 --> 01:04:18.109
Please, no.

01:04:18.519 --> 01:04:19.949
I will save my brother.

01:04:20.079 --> 01:04:23.849
So, can I go ahead and schedule the surgery?
