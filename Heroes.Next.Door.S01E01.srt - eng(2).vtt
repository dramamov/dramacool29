HEROES NEXT DOOR

00:00:42.147 --> 00:00:42.981
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PROFESSIONS, PLACES,

00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:44.024
COMPANIES, ORGANIZATIONS,
ETHNIC GROUPS AND EVENTS ARE NOT REAL.

00:00:44.107 --> 00:00:45.067
ALL CHILD AND ANIMAL SCENES WERE FILMED
SAFELY UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION.

00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:51.239
Immediately after James Sullivan
purchased a big plot of land in Kiyun-si,

00:00:51.323 --> 00:00:53.909
the government made the area
a specialized IT zone.

00:00:53.992 --> 00:00:55.369
- A beer, please.
- Yes.

00:00:55.452 --> 00:00:57.871
- The property prices have skyrocketed
- Here you go, sir.

00:00:57.955 --> 00:00:59.039
- since the announcement.
- Thank you.

00:00:59.122 --> 00:01:03.126
Yes, the property prices have doubled
in a month since the announcement.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.419
There are barely any listings now.

00:01:04.503 --> 00:01:07.923
People say Sullivan
may scrap the investment plan...

00:01:08.256 --> 00:01:09.591
Look at that face.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.093
Look at his face.

00:01:11.176 --> 00:01:12.552
What now?

00:01:12.636 --> 00:01:13.971
He said he wasn't interested at all,

00:01:14.054 --> 00:01:16.431
but look how happy he is
to hear that land values have gone up.

00:01:16.515 --> 00:01:18.558
I don't care if it goes up.

00:01:18.642 --> 00:01:22.145
Why would it be my business
when I plan on staying here forever?

00:01:22.688 --> 00:01:26.024
Why wouldn't you care?
Why wouldn't it be your business?

00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:30.237
The land you're sitting on
is turning from dirt to gold as we speak.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.240
- Don't you get it?
- Really? Where? I don't see it.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.201
Hey, I told you not to drink
on an empty stomach.

00:01:36.285 --> 00:01:38.120
Have some of this, too.

00:01:38.203 --> 00:01:40.289
It's on Byeong-nam today, anyway.

00:01:40.372 --> 00:01:41.581
- Me?
- Yes.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.418
Give that to me. I'll pour it for you.

00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:48.297
Right. I heard you saw a doctor
with your wife this morning.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.548
What did he say?

00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:54.970
Do you really need
everything spelled out for you?

00:01:55.554 --> 00:01:59.433
He's been gloomy all evening.
I could tell from way earlier.

00:01:59.766 --> 00:02:02.102
You're so thick-headed.

00:02:03.228 --> 00:02:05.814
You're so smart that you know everything

00:02:05.897 --> 00:02:07.816
- and crave so much food, right?
- That's right.

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.152
Right. I got something for Byeong-nam.

00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:11.236
What?

00:02:15.324 --> 00:02:17.451
Excuse me, my favorite snack is here.

00:02:17.534 --> 00:02:21.246
- Come here. I'll chew them up for you!
- Stop it!

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.749
My wife got tested for Alzheimer's today.

00:02:28.462 --> 00:02:30.505
The result should be out in two days,

00:02:31.381 --> 00:02:33.467
but the doctor told me to brace myself.

00:02:34.426 --> 00:02:35.677
Do I really need to see the result, then?

00:02:36.345 --> 00:02:38.472
- Come on.
- Come on. Let's drink together.

00:02:38.555 --> 00:02:40.474
And your wife isn't just anyone.

00:02:40.557 --> 00:02:42.184
- She'll be fine.
- Yes.

00:02:42.267 --> 00:02:43.977
Let's toast her health.

00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:45.312
Sure.

00:02:45.395 --> 00:02:47.814
- For your wife's health!
- Cheers!

00:02:47.898 --> 00:02:49.232
- Cheers.
- Right on.

00:02:50.067 --> 00:02:51.610
Everything will be fine.

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:56.448
Hospitals are excellent these days.

00:02:56.698 --> 00:02:58.325
Have another drink.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.955
Right.

00:03:03.705 --> 00:03:07.292
Have another drink,
my immature and clueless friend.

00:03:08.168 --> 00:03:10.545
- Gosh, seriously.
- Hey, so...

00:03:11.296 --> 00:03:13.966
- Hey, stop.
- What?

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.842
- Hey!
- Sorry.

00:03:16.468 --> 00:03:18.261
Didn't I tell you
that alcohol was holy water?

00:03:18.345 --> 00:03:21.181
It's because of that guy
driving with the headlights on.

00:03:21.264 --> 00:03:22.683
Man, what is he doing?

00:03:22.766 --> 00:03:24.476
He must be out of his mind.

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:26.728
He's driving like a menace. It's scary.

00:03:27.062 --> 00:03:29.773
I told you we needed security cameras
at intersections...

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.449
What?

00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:40.951
What? Did he crash?

00:03:41.285 --> 00:03:42.536
- What's going on?
- What?

00:03:43.537 --> 00:03:44.663
- What?
- What happened?

00:03:44.746 --> 00:03:45.831
- What?
- Hold up.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.129
- Oh, man.
- What if someone's inside?

00:03:52.212 --> 00:03:55.382
- Call 911!
- What's their number?

00:03:55.465 --> 00:03:56.842
- Ji-hun, call 911!
- Yes!

00:03:58.635 --> 00:04:00.262
- Call 911!
- Let's save the people first.

00:04:00.345 --> 00:04:01.346
Okay.

00:04:05.767 --> 00:04:08.478
What? Where are you going?

00:04:08.562 --> 00:04:09.730
Oh, gosh.

00:04:11.815 --> 00:04:13.483
Hey, get me some tools.

00:04:13.567 --> 00:04:15.611
- Okay.
- You need to hurry!

00:04:16.236 --> 00:04:17.362
Hurry! Go!

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.492
Oh, goodness.

00:04:22.576 --> 00:04:23.493
We have to go!

00:05:07.788 --> 00:05:13.794
FIRST EXPLOSION
ON AUG 16, 2025 AT 12:30 A.M.

00:05:16.588 --> 00:05:21.093
EPISODE 1:
HASN'T EVEN SERVED IN THE MILITARY

00:05:35.816 --> 00:05:39.736
Here's some news about Kiyun-si,
Sullivan's new hot specialized zone.

00:05:39.903 --> 00:05:41.363
He's an ethnically-Korean IT genius

00:05:41.446 --> 00:05:44.866
and the founder of the Joinus Company,
also known as one of the top ten figures

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.660
with the most global influence.

00:05:46.743 --> 00:05:50.455
CEO Sullivan purchased a big plot of land
on the outskirts of Kiyun-si.

00:05:50.622 --> 00:05:53.375
The government then announced plans
to make this region

00:05:53.458 --> 00:05:55.961
Asia's largest specialized zone
for IT tourism.

00:05:56.044 --> 00:05:59.756
This attracted nationwide attention,
and within a month of the announcement,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.302
the region had witnessed
exponential increases in property prices.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.721
Everyone is keeping a keen eye

00:06:05.887 --> 00:06:11.018
on Kiyun-si's development
after being chosen by James Sullivan.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.770
SPECIAL MARTIAL ARTS YONGMU GYM
The local governments and businesses are

00:06:13.854 --> 00:06:15.272
moving fast to welcome the development.

00:06:15.355 --> 00:06:16.565
MAMMOSEU MART

00:06:16.648 --> 00:06:17.941
Next up, the weather.

00:06:18.025 --> 00:06:22.070
The sky is clear all across the country,
including Kiyun-si.

00:06:22.195 --> 00:06:25.824
The temperature has risen quite a bit,
so you'll feel some heat in the afternoon.

00:06:25.907 --> 00:06:29.411
But the humidity level isn't high,
so it'll be a pleasant day.

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:42.174
Yes?

00:06:42.507 --> 00:06:45.177
- You have a delivery.
- Thank you.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.428
- Have a good day.
- Thanks.

00:06:58.357 --> 00:06:59.524
Good morning.

00:07:05.948 --> 00:07:08.450
My princess,
did someone kidnap you at night?

00:07:08.533 --> 00:07:10.160
Your hair looks like
you've been dragged somewhere.

00:07:10.243 --> 00:07:11.620
Water.

00:07:11.703 --> 00:07:12.871
Yes, water. Come here.

00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:17.167
All right.

00:07:21.546 --> 00:07:22.547
Here.

00:07:25.008 --> 00:07:27.302
Daddy will make you
the best egg fried rice,

00:07:27.386 --> 00:07:28.595
so go and wash your face.

00:07:28.679 --> 00:07:29.972
You have to eat and go to kindergarten.

00:07:31.515 --> 00:07:33.183
Make my hair into bunny ears.

00:07:34.476 --> 00:07:35.519
What?

00:07:36.019 --> 00:07:38.730
You promised to wear
the apple bun hair to kindergarten.

00:07:39.106 --> 00:07:40.941
Don't tell me you've forgotten.

00:07:41.275 --> 00:07:43.485
Fine, give me bunny ears
when we go to the amusement park.

00:07:43.568 --> 00:07:47.447
Got it, Princess Bunny.

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:49.825
Wash up.

00:07:54.496 --> 00:07:55.789
It's chilly.

00:08:06.591 --> 00:08:07.426
Yes?

00:08:10.595 --> 00:08:12.973
- And you are?
- I'm the head of the neighborhood.

00:08:13.056 --> 00:08:14.349
I live in the next building.

00:08:14.433 --> 00:08:16.351
I just wanted to drop by
before going to the store.

00:08:16.893 --> 00:08:19.730
Moving is a lot of work, isn't it?

00:08:19.813 --> 00:08:21.315
Gosh, I'm dying here.

00:08:22.566 --> 00:08:24.192
So what brings you here?

00:08:24.443 --> 00:08:27.029
I need your confirmation of residence.

00:08:27.237 --> 00:08:28.947
You actually live here, right?

00:08:29.031 --> 00:08:30.866
- Yes.
- Please sign it, then.

00:08:31.366 --> 00:08:35.495
We haven't had anyone move in for so long.
It's so nice to see a new face.

00:08:36.288 --> 00:08:40.542
And you might get in trouble
if you don't sort your garbage properly,

00:08:40.626 --> 00:08:43.211
so read this carefully
and follow the rules, okay?

00:08:43.295 --> 00:08:46.423
The youth association president
does daily rounds to check.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.634
- Rounds?
- Of course.

00:08:49.426 --> 00:08:51.428
I didn't know this neighborhood
had a youth association president.

00:08:51.511 --> 00:08:53.180
That's so cool.

00:08:59.436 --> 00:09:01.229
My, my.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.899
NEIGHBORHOOD RECYCLING AREA

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.328
What lunatic
didn't even bother to recycle?

00:09:29.675 --> 00:09:32.302
This one is out of their mind.

00:09:36.974 --> 00:09:38.725
Man...

00:10:04.126 --> 00:10:05.460
Try it!

00:10:15.304 --> 00:10:16.305
How sweet.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.057
FRESHLY PICKED SWEET APPLES
Sweet, right? See?

00:10:19.141 --> 00:10:21.476
It's red, glowing,

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.021
and absolutely delicious-looking!

00:10:25.397 --> 00:10:29.192
So, why are you giving away
a whole extra bag of such good apples?

00:10:29.276 --> 00:10:31.194
You must lose a lot of money doing that.

00:10:31.278 --> 00:10:34.698
You're only seeing one side of this,
aren't you?

00:10:34.781 --> 00:10:36.575
- What now?
- Ladies,

00:10:36.658 --> 00:10:38.285
it's not just studying
that has a prime era.

00:10:38.368 --> 00:10:40.370
Fruit also has its peak era.

00:10:40.454 --> 00:10:42.247
And when are they most delicious?

00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:45.167
Right now! It's at its best right now.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:48.337
Therefore... When? Just today.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:49.546
How many bags?

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.882
One extra bag for everyone!

00:10:51.965 --> 00:10:55.135
If you still don't believe me,
just take one bag.

00:10:55.218 --> 00:10:58.055
What? Why? I didn't say I didn't want it.

00:10:59.348 --> 00:11:01.183
It's just too good to believe.

00:11:01.767 --> 00:11:04.478
- Here.
- Let's go. All right.

00:11:04.561 --> 00:11:06.396
Hold up.

00:11:07.064 --> 00:11:10.108
These may just look like regular apples,

00:11:10.317 --> 00:11:12.778
but they're heavy
because they're filled with honey.

00:11:12.861 --> 00:11:13.862
Can you carry them fine?

00:11:13.946 --> 00:11:16.615
They're too heavy, even for me to carry!

00:11:18.241 --> 00:11:19.326
Why not?

00:11:20.744 --> 00:11:21.578
See?

00:11:22.537 --> 00:11:25.499
- I'm totally fine.
- Easy. Nice.

00:11:25.582 --> 00:11:28.502
I could carry all of this
if you gave it to me for free.

00:11:29.044 --> 00:11:31.546
Okay, my special lady.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.006
Here's one more for you.

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:34.591
But here's a question.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:38.637
Do you know what happens
when an apple gets old?

00:11:39.888 --> 00:11:41.098
What?

00:11:45.018 --> 00:11:48.563
It becomes a Granny Smith.

00:11:50.023 --> 00:11:51.525
Granny!

00:11:53.193 --> 00:11:54.027
Sure.

00:11:55.362 --> 00:11:57.823
- I hope you sell a lot.
- Thanks.

00:11:58.657 --> 00:11:59.866
Get home safely!

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.201
It's delicious.

00:12:07.374 --> 00:12:11.461
Hello, ma'am.
I guess your arm is all good now.

00:12:11.545 --> 00:12:13.213
I thought you couldn't even lift a spoon.

00:12:14.798 --> 00:12:17.217
Oh! Gosh, I'm still in pain.

00:12:17.301 --> 00:12:20.345
I don't have the energy to lift
a single finger,

00:12:20.429 --> 00:12:22.764
but I still have housework to do,
so I'm forcing myself.

00:12:22.848 --> 00:12:26.685
Come on. I heard you say
you could lift anything heavy just fine.

00:12:26.768 --> 00:12:29.855
I got it all on camera, thank you.

00:12:29.938 --> 00:12:32.941
Who gave you permission to film me?

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.777
- Who gave you permission?
- Oh, gosh!

00:12:36.945 --> 00:12:40.949
This is illegal in Korea!

00:12:41.658 --> 00:12:42.826
Ma'am, wait!

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:48.707
It's all on the dashcam here!

00:12:49.166 --> 00:12:51.043
That's not illegal!

00:12:51.752 --> 00:12:54.296
Don't be a Granny Smith.

00:12:54.379 --> 00:12:57.382
Granny Smith!

00:12:57.466 --> 00:12:59.468
- Granny Smith!
- What's wrong with you?

00:12:59.551 --> 00:13:01.720
Granny Smith!

00:13:01.803 --> 00:13:03.972
- What's with you?
- Two bags!

00:13:04.056 --> 00:13:06.808
- Oh, yes!
- That's mine!

00:13:06.892 --> 00:13:09.603
VEOTIGO INSURANCE

00:13:11.271 --> 00:13:12.314
Yes.

00:13:12.397 --> 00:13:14.691
OUR ANSWER LIES ON SITE

00:13:14.775 --> 00:13:17.569
So, both parties were at fault.

00:13:17.653 --> 00:13:20.238
Both parties are technically at fault
because it was a flashing light,

00:13:20.322 --> 00:13:21.740
but the other car
was most likely speeding.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.242
There must be skid marks or something.

00:13:24.326 --> 00:13:25.494
There's nothing.

00:13:25.702 --> 00:13:28.914
They rushed for whatever reason
and cleaned up everything within an hour.

00:13:30.123 --> 00:13:31.208
Any witnesses?

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:34.711
No cars? And the driver?

00:13:37.297 --> 00:13:40.092
Sure, look into it and call me.

00:13:42.886 --> 00:13:44.054
What's all that?

00:13:45.389 --> 00:13:46.598
All right.

00:13:47.849 --> 00:13:50.143
For you and the team to try some.

00:13:51.436 --> 00:13:55.524
You brought two boxes for us to try some?

00:13:56.108 --> 00:13:57.776
Hey!

00:13:58.485 --> 00:14:00.112
The orchard owner gave you these,
didn't he?

00:14:01.571 --> 00:14:02.739
No, he bought it himself.

00:14:03.615 --> 00:14:05.492
There are three more boxes
in the parking lot.

00:14:06.827 --> 00:14:09.121
Five boxes in total? With what money?

00:14:09.204 --> 00:14:10.831
With the project fund, of course.

00:14:11.415 --> 00:14:13.250
You should've seen it.

00:14:13.709 --> 00:14:17.754
Ms. Lee carried these two heavy bags
like it was nothing,

00:14:17.838 --> 00:14:20.299
and Mr. Kim appeared out of nowhere.

00:14:20.382 --> 00:14:23.135
He was like,
"I guess your arm is all good now."

00:14:25.053 --> 00:14:27.097
You're the employee of the month.
You're the best.

00:14:27.389 --> 00:14:30.267
Orchards are struggling these days.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:32.936
It's so bad
that this orchard owner set up a truck--

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.271
Again?

00:14:35.564 --> 00:14:36.857
Here's our Mother Theresa again.

00:14:37.649 --> 00:14:39.401
Are we a charity?

00:14:39.818 --> 00:14:41.528
Mr. Kim, why didn't you stop him?

00:14:41.612 --> 00:14:44.448
Believe me, I tried. But you know him.

00:14:44.531 --> 00:14:47.075
He doesn't listen to anyone.

00:14:47.993 --> 00:14:50.412
This is so much money!

00:14:50.537 --> 00:14:51.955
It wasn't much.

00:14:52.873 --> 00:14:55.751
It's 400,000 won for 5 boxes,

00:14:55.834 --> 00:14:58.253
but I got a huge discount on them.

00:14:59.838 --> 00:15:00.839
I paid 300,000 won.

00:15:03.925 --> 00:15:06.511
- What? Again?
- My blood pressure is rising again.

00:15:07.471 --> 00:15:11.683
My gosh! I told you to see a doctor
and get your meds soon!

00:15:11.767 --> 00:15:14.061
- Hey.
- My gosh.

00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:18.148
I'm off to the hospital
to meet with the grasshopper patient.

00:15:19.274 --> 00:15:20.901
Hold up.

00:15:27.491 --> 00:15:29.493
Such peace without my wife's nagging.

00:15:30.452 --> 00:15:32.788
I just want a month of this good rest.

00:15:35.666 --> 00:15:37.834
You can easily make it two.

00:15:44.591 --> 00:15:45.634
Who's there?

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.562
Do you want to know how?

00:15:58.939 --> 00:16:02.651
How to look even more in pain
than you already are?

00:16:05.529 --> 00:16:07.531
- Get whiny?
- Whiny?

00:16:08.031 --> 00:16:10.826
Life is all about a strong mind.

00:16:10.909 --> 00:16:11.994
A strong mind?

00:16:12.077 --> 00:16:15.247
It's a crime and a fraud
to pretend to be in pain when you're not.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:19.251
So you must know
how to draw the pain from the inside

00:16:19.334 --> 00:16:21.878
and express it to others.

00:16:24.548 --> 00:16:27.426
Oh, gosh, there's my master.

00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:28.802
Sorry for not recognizing you sooner.

00:16:29.136 --> 00:16:31.680
Master, how do I do that?

00:16:31.763 --> 00:16:34.141
I can tell
you have a stiff neck and shoulders.

00:16:34.224 --> 00:16:35.350
That's right.

00:16:35.434 --> 00:16:40.063
I jumped into a fire to save people,

00:16:40.147 --> 00:16:42.816
and my old shoulder pain

00:16:42.899 --> 00:16:45.152
seems to have fired up again
from the shock.

00:16:45.235 --> 00:16:47.988
Yes, the shock. That's the key.

00:16:48.071 --> 00:16:50.324
Now, be in pain sincerely.

00:16:50.407 --> 00:16:51.450
This?

00:16:52.367 --> 00:16:54.411
Oh, no. My shoulder!

00:16:54.494 --> 00:16:57.456
My shoulder is now in so much pain
after talking about it.

00:16:57.539 --> 00:16:59.916
That's the kind of trauma you experience
after a car accident.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.918
It's so hard to recover from those.

00:17:02.002 --> 00:17:04.838
The human body is so fascinating.

00:17:06.381 --> 00:17:09.384
Man, I think the pain is getting worse.

00:17:09.468 --> 00:17:12.679
Right? Good work.
Do that when the insurance company comes.

00:17:12.763 --> 00:17:15.015
Thank you for this enlightenment.

00:17:15.098 --> 00:17:16.141
It's nothing.

00:17:16.224 --> 00:17:18.393
You have to get the angle right.

00:17:22.731 --> 00:17:23.774
Who are you?

00:17:24.232 --> 00:17:25.484
Me?

00:17:26.234 --> 00:17:27.319
I...

00:17:29.196 --> 00:17:30.405
I'm...

00:17:32.074 --> 00:17:35.202
Oh, this guy, Ji Dong-man.

00:17:35.285 --> 00:17:38.580
- I'm his friend.
- The big bearded guy?

00:17:38.664 --> 00:17:42.042
Yes, that's right.
And he's so loud when he chews.

00:17:42.334 --> 00:17:43.710
He got discharged yesterday.

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:45.837
Oh, really?

00:17:47.047 --> 00:17:51.510
He didn't say anything about leaving
when I spoke to him on the phone.

00:17:52.344 --> 00:17:53.720
Hey, look at me.

00:17:56.723 --> 00:17:59.059
Man, he's not picking up.

00:17:59.977 --> 00:18:02.396
That's too bad.
I can't bring these apples back.

00:18:03.647 --> 00:18:05.941
Put them here. They look heavy.

00:18:06.024 --> 00:18:07.484
Yes, put them over here.

00:18:07.818 --> 00:18:08.860
Sure.

00:18:09.194 --> 00:18:11.989
You two can share.
You must eat well to get better soon.

00:18:14.408 --> 00:18:15.492
My goodness.

00:18:16.618 --> 00:18:18.662
These apples are top-notch.

00:18:18.912 --> 00:18:21.915
Right? You know your apples.

00:18:21.999 --> 00:18:26.295
I gave some to a friend,
and he said all apples were the same.

00:18:26.586 --> 00:18:29.673
- Thank you.
- I run a grocery store

00:18:29.881 --> 00:18:32.926
and can tell an apple's Brix
just by its color.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:34.511
A grocery store.

00:18:35.637 --> 00:18:38.557
No wonder you have a good eye.

00:18:39.391 --> 00:18:42.644
By the way, how did you two end up here?

00:18:42.894 --> 00:18:46.023
Me? You know, an accident.

00:18:46.106 --> 00:18:47.691
Right, an accident.

00:18:49.568 --> 00:18:50.611
And you, Mr. Grocery Store?

00:18:51.903 --> 00:18:55.240
You know, a car accident.

00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:04.374
You have to find the right point.

00:19:04.458 --> 00:19:08.754
Now that I've found it,
my shoulder is suddenly in so much pain.

00:19:08.837 --> 00:19:10.213
No way.

00:19:11.298 --> 00:19:13.258
How's that possible? You're lying.

00:19:13.342 --> 00:19:15.677
- No, I'm not.
- Liar.

00:19:15.761 --> 00:19:17.220
- I don't believe you.
- No.

00:19:18.138 --> 00:19:20.182
I didn't believe him at first, either.

00:19:20.265 --> 00:19:23.435
But I did as he told me, and it worked.

00:19:23.518 --> 00:19:25.145
Really?

00:19:25.979 --> 00:19:27.105
How long have you been here for?

00:19:27.481 --> 00:19:29.691
It's been about three months for me.

00:19:29.775 --> 00:19:33.070
I've moved between hospitals,
depending on where it hurts.

00:19:33.695 --> 00:19:36.698
Master, how can you change where it hurts?

00:19:36.782 --> 00:19:38.533
Show me your ways.

00:19:39.076 --> 00:19:41.620
- Are you curious?
- Yes, we are!

00:19:41.703 --> 00:19:42.871
Absolutely.

00:19:44.122 --> 00:19:46.083
Okay, so...

00:19:50.462 --> 00:19:52.089
Why am I getting a call?

00:19:53.632 --> 00:19:55.717
Excuse me. I have to take this.

00:19:55.801 --> 00:19:57.427
Don't share your secret until I'm back.

00:19:57.511 --> 00:19:59.930
- I'm curious, too.
- Just take the call here.

00:20:00.681 --> 00:20:01.515
Okay.

00:20:02.808 --> 00:20:05.018
What now? This is an important moment.

00:20:05.102 --> 00:20:07.521
Every moment I've worked with you
has felt very important.

00:20:07.604 --> 00:20:08.939
When I first met you, I--

00:20:09.022 --> 00:20:10.524
Are you confessing your love to me?

00:20:10.899 --> 00:20:12.985
I'm married, so are you sure?

00:20:13.068 --> 00:20:13.902
What?

00:20:15.487 --> 00:20:19.157
Whatever.
There's a Kim Su-il at that hospital.

00:20:20.617 --> 00:20:21.827
KIM **-IL

00:20:22.744 --> 00:20:25.122
Is he a witness? Okay.

00:20:27.291 --> 00:20:29.042
Really?

00:20:29.751 --> 00:20:31.545
I passed by there.

00:20:32.921 --> 00:20:34.006
Okay.

00:20:39.386 --> 00:20:41.305
- That's funny.
- How's the apple?

00:20:48.061 --> 00:20:49.187
Honey...

00:20:50.522 --> 00:20:53.317
I told you
to get the scratch on your face treated.

00:20:54.443 --> 00:20:55.652
But here you are, hospitalized.

00:20:56.361 --> 00:20:58.572
Are you in a lot of pain?

00:20:59.031 --> 00:21:02.618
That's too bad.
We've got deliveries backed up.

00:21:03.535 --> 00:21:05.162
Honey, it's not what you think.

00:21:05.954 --> 00:21:08.457
Car accidents lead to trauma.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:09.833
Car accidents?

00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:11.918
I wasn't the driver,

00:21:12.002 --> 00:21:15.881
but I dove into a huge fire of ashes
to save others--

00:21:15.964 --> 00:21:16.923
A huge fire?

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:19.468
I...

00:21:19.551 --> 00:21:20.802
Mr. Kim Su-il.

00:21:21.553 --> 00:21:25.140
You're the witness of the collision
at the Kiyun Intersection earlier, right?

00:21:26.183 --> 00:21:27.351
Who are you?

00:21:29.311 --> 00:21:32.022
Oh, I'm from Veotigo Insurance.

00:21:32.397 --> 00:21:34.733
I'm Choi Kang of the SIU Team. Here.

00:21:35.233 --> 00:21:36.735
What does "SIU" stand for?

00:21:36.818 --> 00:21:40.030
"Special Investigation Unit,"

00:21:40.113 --> 00:21:42.574
so, a unit that conducts
special investigations.

00:21:42.658 --> 00:21:44.952
Oh, my back!

00:21:45.911 --> 00:21:48.956
I deal with people who are in pain
whenever they see me,

00:21:49.039 --> 00:21:52.209
as well as fake diagnoses,
overtreatment, and fraudulent claims.

00:21:52.292 --> 00:21:54.711
I do all sorts of things
to investigate these cases.

00:21:55.587 --> 00:21:58.256
Sir, it's too late. I recorded everything.

00:21:58.799 --> 00:22:01.259
So, you're saying
Veotigo Insurance is here

00:22:01.343 --> 00:22:04.554
to compensate
for the scar on my husband's face?

00:22:04.805 --> 00:22:07.391
We'll have to discuss the details later,

00:22:07.766 --> 00:22:09.643
but basically, yes.

00:22:09.977 --> 00:22:14.189
But before that, he must tell us in detail
what happened on site.

00:22:14.273 --> 00:22:16.316
Let me say one thing before that.

00:22:17.109 --> 00:22:19.194
I'm getting him discharged now,

00:22:19.278 --> 00:22:22.739
so we'd just like
a fair amount of compensation.

00:22:22.823 --> 00:22:25.117
I'll nurse him back to good health

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.370
and make sure he doesn't complain
about neck pain or anything later.

00:22:28.996 --> 00:22:31.039
Honey, my neck really does hurt.

00:22:31.123 --> 00:22:32.958
But I think I'm all good now.

00:22:35.752 --> 00:22:36.628
Okay.

00:22:37.379 --> 00:22:38.755
You were on site, right?

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.884
- Yes.
- What happened?

00:22:43.593 --> 00:22:45.429
So much happened.

00:22:46.179 --> 00:22:50.017
I don't know where to begin or end.

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.728
From how you snuck out at night
to drink your brains out?

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:55.689
All right.

00:22:56.607 --> 00:22:59.276
So, my buddy, Byeong-nam...

00:24:01.713 --> 00:24:03.423
Gosh, hot.

00:24:04.132 --> 00:24:05.884
Oh, man.

00:24:08.553 --> 00:24:09.513
Here.

00:24:14.267 --> 00:24:15.143
No way.

00:24:15.894 --> 00:24:17.604
Can it corner properly now?

00:24:17.688 --> 00:24:20.941
It was off-balance because it was old.
I just added some weight in the front.

00:24:22.401 --> 00:24:23.402
That's sick.

00:24:24.152 --> 00:24:26.280
- You're sick, sir.
- Sick?

00:24:27.364 --> 00:24:29.241
- You ate this up.
- Ate this?

00:24:29.574 --> 00:24:30.784
Eat what?

00:24:31.702 --> 00:24:35.122
Anyway, I fixed the balance,
but come back if it's still not good.

00:24:36.498 --> 00:24:38.000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:24:38.083 --> 00:24:39.876
- Goodbye.
- Have a good day.

00:24:40.836 --> 00:24:43.297
August, 2025...

00:24:44.923 --> 00:24:47.467
Byeong-nam, come out! It's your bro!

00:24:48.552 --> 00:24:49.636
Man.

00:24:50.637 --> 00:24:51.805
HARDWARE DREAM TREE STATIONERY
Byeong-nam!

00:24:52.806 --> 00:24:53.849
What now?

00:24:54.891 --> 00:24:57.352
How are you feeling?

00:24:57.769 --> 00:25:01.106
Don't you see me making deliveries
right after getting discharged?

00:25:01.189 --> 00:25:02.983
Discharged? When were you admitted?

00:25:03.066 --> 00:25:05.319
This morning! Why didn't you come?

00:25:05.402 --> 00:25:08.780
You got admitted and discharged
in just one morning?

00:25:10.282 --> 00:25:11.658
You're sick.

00:25:12.659 --> 00:25:13.493
Sick?

00:25:14.077 --> 00:25:15.412
You ate it up.

00:25:16.872 --> 00:25:18.498
Who taught you new slang words?

00:25:19.166 --> 00:25:20.834
Whatever. Anyway,

00:25:20.917 --> 00:25:22.961
my wife is in a bad mood today,
so don't come to our store.

00:25:23.045 --> 00:25:24.504
Go to the convenience store
if you need anything.

00:25:24.713 --> 00:25:27.382
Stop going behind her back like that.
That's why she scolds you.

00:25:27.466 --> 00:25:29.593
Go before she gets even angrier. Go.

00:25:29.676 --> 00:25:31.345
What do you say? A drink tonight?

00:25:31.762 --> 00:25:33.513
- Sure, go.
- You down?

00:25:33.597 --> 00:25:36.475
- Sure.
- Okay, sick.

00:25:36.558 --> 00:25:38.560
Just get going already.

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:42.522
Call me for a drink later, okay?

00:25:48.153 --> 00:25:49.321
You're pathetic.

00:25:57.037 --> 00:25:58.121
CAR INSURANCE CERTIFICATE

00:25:58.205 --> 00:26:00.540
CAR OWNER INFORMATION

00:26:23.772 --> 00:26:25.691
Why am I so good at my job?

00:26:25.774 --> 00:26:28.902
It's not even lunchtime yet,
and I've already handled two cases.

00:26:29.736 --> 00:26:31.780
That's who I am, Boss.

00:26:32.197 --> 00:26:33.448
You seem giddy.

00:26:34.157 --> 00:26:35.867
You got Mr. Grasshopper's agreement?

00:26:35.951 --> 00:26:37.244
Of course.

00:26:37.327 --> 00:26:39.454
I got him confessing
about moving between three hospitals

00:26:39.538 --> 00:26:42.916
and about his special ability
to use his mind to bring out pain.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.293
It's all in here.

00:26:44.376 --> 00:26:46.712
Special ability?
Is he claiming to be mentally ill now?

00:26:47.045 --> 00:26:48.922
No, it's not like that.

00:26:49.172 --> 00:26:53.135
But if he did that,
I wouldn't let him off the hook easily.

00:26:53.343 --> 00:26:56.138
You know me. I don't let anything slide.

00:26:57.431 --> 00:26:59.182
Is this the accident site?

00:26:59.975 --> 00:27:02.102
There wasn't anything this morning
on my way to work.

00:27:03.103 --> 00:27:05.022
Huh? You don't drive through here
to get to work.

00:27:06.064 --> 00:27:07.899
I moved.

00:27:07.983 --> 00:27:10.944
To the neighborhood up there.
I told you last time.

00:27:12.571 --> 00:27:14.573
That neighborhood
is getting all the attention nowadays.

00:27:17.326 --> 00:27:20.746
It was your wife's idea, wasn't it?

00:27:21.038 --> 00:27:23.540
So, how much do you think
you'll earn from the property?

00:27:26.043 --> 00:27:30.380
That's only for my wife to know.
I know nothing.

00:27:30.464 --> 00:27:31.673
Man, let go.

00:27:31.757 --> 00:27:34.718
I just pack and unpack as I'm told.

00:27:36.261 --> 00:27:37.763
What are you looking for?

00:27:37.971 --> 00:27:39.348
Anything odd.

00:27:40.766 --> 00:27:46.313
Why were they in such a rush
to clean it all up in an hour?

00:27:46.897 --> 00:27:48.482
The car exploded.

00:27:49.149 --> 00:27:51.443
They must've cleaned it up
because the fragments were a hazard.

00:27:52.694 --> 00:27:54.112
You know what's really fishy?

00:27:55.072 --> 00:27:57.991
There's nothing
on the other car or the driver.

00:27:58.075 --> 00:28:01.703
No idea whether they're alive or dead.
But the other car is more at fault.

00:28:03.205 --> 00:28:04.831
Was it not caught
on the dashcam from our side?

00:28:04.915 --> 00:28:09.503
There's no dashcam or anything.
Everything was shattered.

00:28:10.504 --> 00:28:12.130
You can take this case.

00:28:14.758 --> 00:28:15.801
Me?

00:28:15.884 --> 00:28:17.302
You live nearby.

00:28:17.803 --> 00:28:19.888
That's not a good reason to take a case.

00:28:20.555 --> 00:28:24.476
Sang-guk is
in charge of site investigations.

00:28:24.559 --> 00:28:27.729
Sang-guk is on five cases right now.

00:28:28.522 --> 00:28:32.109
Use your special ability or whatever
to trace the other car and its driver.

00:28:32.192 --> 00:28:34.945
That ability isn't mine!
Have you even been listening?

00:28:39.783 --> 00:28:40.867
Man.

00:28:56.842 --> 00:28:59.386
- Dismiss us already.
- Come on!

00:29:00.804 --> 00:29:03.765
- What is it?
- That's still better.

00:29:04.224 --> 00:29:06.226
Hello, this is Min-seo's mom.

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:08.812
Let's do the level test at the store
instead of at home.

00:29:08.895 --> 00:29:10.606
I can't leave the store unoccupied.

00:29:11.273 --> 00:29:13.025
Yes, ma'am.

00:29:13.108 --> 00:29:14.318
Everyone.

00:29:15.736 --> 00:29:19.323
There won't be a discharge ceremony,
as the Battalion Commander is at his base.

00:29:22.117 --> 00:29:24.870
You're excused once you complete the drill
that was canceled due to rain yesterday.

00:29:25.537 --> 00:29:26.872
Hey, a drink after this?

00:29:27.456 --> 00:29:28.957
I have to go for Min-seo's level test.

00:29:29.041 --> 00:29:31.918
Come on. Let's drink. Please?

00:29:32.002 --> 00:29:33.045
After.

00:29:33.295 --> 00:29:35.339
There's no discharge ceremony,
and this is the last drill,

00:29:35.422 --> 00:29:38.050
so let's have you
disassemble and assemble guns.

00:29:38.133 --> 00:29:39.593
TRAINING RESERVED FORCES
TO SERVE THE NATION

00:29:39.676 --> 00:29:41.303
- Come on!
- It's the last task.

00:29:41.386 --> 00:29:42.429
A gun?

00:29:42.512 --> 00:29:45.682
Should we make a bet
to make you focus better?

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:50.354
I'll let you out early
if you're better than our trainer, okay?

00:29:50.771 --> 00:29:52.940
- Sweet!
- You said you were good!

00:29:53.315 --> 00:29:55.525
Do you remember how to do that?

00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:59.279
What are you doing?

00:29:59.696 --> 00:30:01.490
HOW TO DISASSEMBLE AND ASSEMBLE A K2 RIFLE

00:30:04.201 --> 00:30:07.663
Sir, will you really let us off early
if we beat the trainer?

00:30:08.914 --> 00:30:11.875
He's the fastest in our battalion.
Are you sure?

00:30:14.503 --> 00:30:15.671
He accepts the challenge!

00:30:18.131 --> 00:30:19.091
Are you kidding me?

00:30:23.804 --> 00:30:25.430
- You still got it!
- Let's go!

00:30:26.056 --> 00:30:27.140
Ready,

00:30:27.599 --> 00:30:29.810
set, go!

00:30:49.621 --> 00:30:52.416
Fifty-eight seconds. A new record.

00:30:55.043 --> 00:30:56.586
You're insane, Jeong-hwan!

00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:59.089
Totally insane! Awesome!

00:31:00.716 --> 00:31:02.009
You did it!

00:31:15.897 --> 00:31:17.357
You'd better pay for the beer today.

00:31:17.482 --> 00:31:18.692
No!

00:31:18.775 --> 00:31:20.652
- Get out, then.
- Sorry.

00:31:27.159 --> 00:31:28.368
It's like we're on a trip.

00:31:40.505 --> 00:31:45.010
KINDERGARTEN

00:31:50.307 --> 00:31:52.059
SPECIAL MARTIAL ARTS YONGMU GYM

00:31:52.142 --> 00:31:54.019
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:31:54.102 --> 00:31:56.438
Stand straight! Salute to the master.

00:31:56.521 --> 00:31:57.814
- Salute!
- Salute!

00:31:57.898 --> 00:31:59.650
- Salute!
- Welcome.

00:31:59.733 --> 00:32:01.443
- Come in.
- Get in.

00:32:01.526 --> 00:32:02.903
- Hello, Master.
- Hello.

00:32:02.986 --> 00:32:04.613
Watch your steps.

00:32:05.405 --> 00:32:06.239
Be careful.

00:32:06.949 --> 00:32:09.534
Hello, you're a new face.

00:32:10.077 --> 00:32:12.621
- She's a new student starting today.
- Is she?

00:32:12.704 --> 00:32:13.872
What's your name?

00:32:13.956 --> 00:32:15.165
Choi Do-yeon.

00:32:15.248 --> 00:32:16.625
I see, Do-yeon.

00:32:16.708 --> 00:32:21.838
You'd have so much fun
training with your friends after class.

00:32:23.048 --> 00:32:26.593
Make sure to ask your mom to sign you up
when you go home, okay?

00:32:28.971 --> 00:32:31.264
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

00:32:44.194 --> 00:32:45.445
Dad!

00:32:45.737 --> 00:32:46.947
Hey!

00:32:48.824 --> 00:32:50.534
You're right on time.

00:32:58.959 --> 00:33:00.419
Hello!

00:33:00.836 --> 00:33:03.672
I'm right on time.
I was ten seconds too early.

00:33:05.799 --> 00:33:06.883
Sure.

00:33:06.967 --> 00:33:08.719
See you tomorrow, Do-yeon.

00:33:08.802 --> 00:33:11.096
Bye. Goodbye, sir.

00:33:11.179 --> 00:33:13.515
- Thank you.
- Bye.

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:19.271
How was the new kindergarten?
Did you have fun with your new friends?

00:33:19.354 --> 00:33:21.690
Yes, we made stuffed bunnies.

00:33:22.024 --> 00:33:25.569
Dad, I want to go to the martial arts gym
instead of ballet.

00:33:26.445 --> 00:33:27.946
- A martial arts gym?
- Yes.

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:31.241
All my friends left in the gym van,
except me.

00:33:32.784 --> 00:33:33.785
I see.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:40.500
SPECIAL MARTIAL ARTS YONGMU GYM

00:33:40.709 --> 00:33:44.004
Focus!

00:33:44.338 --> 00:33:47.841
If you die,
you're a liability to your team!

00:33:47.924 --> 00:33:49.092
Jump!

00:33:52.638 --> 00:33:55.307
Watch out for your comrades!
Or else, they'll die!

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:56.516
Jump!

00:34:00.646 --> 00:34:02.731
I'm sorry, my comrades.

00:34:04.358 --> 00:34:05.275
Let me up.

00:34:05.359 --> 00:34:07.778
- Okay.
- Let's go again!

00:34:07.861 --> 00:34:09.446
Do-yeon is here! Are you her father?

00:34:09.529 --> 00:34:10.822
Where are you going?

00:34:10.906 --> 00:34:13.367
Okay, let me go!

00:34:13.825 --> 00:34:14.910
Ready!

00:34:16.703 --> 00:34:17.996
Kick one!

00:34:20.624 --> 00:34:21.875
Kick two!

00:34:24.252 --> 00:34:25.379
Kick three!

00:34:25.504 --> 00:34:27.089
As you can see,

00:34:27.172 --> 00:34:30.384
it's excellent for increasing stamina
and stimulating growth.

00:34:30.467 --> 00:34:31.551
Kick two!

00:34:31.635 --> 00:34:34.554
And our classes are all about having fun,

00:34:34.638 --> 00:34:36.181
so kids really love it here.

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:38.850
- Yes?
- I need to use the bathroom.

00:34:38.934 --> 00:34:40.268
You want to use the bathroom?

00:34:40.352 --> 00:34:43.146
Master Kim, he needs to use the bathroom!

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:44.231
- Okay!
- Okay.

00:34:45.107 --> 00:34:49.486
Most importantly, we watch kids
in double-income households.

00:34:49.569 --> 00:34:51.488
After the kids finish with classes,

00:34:51.571 --> 00:34:54.199
they come and stay here
until their parents are off work,

00:34:54.283 --> 00:34:56.118
and the parents
can pick them up from here.

00:34:56.201 --> 00:34:57.828
What is it, A-rin?

00:34:57.911 --> 00:34:59.705
Join us already, Master.

00:34:59.788 --> 00:35:03.208
Okay, but I'm talking to someone now.

00:35:03.417 --> 00:35:04.793
- Go back.
- Okay.

00:35:05.711 --> 00:35:06.586
Hurry.

00:35:11.216 --> 00:35:13.385
And if you're worried about safety,

00:35:13.468 --> 00:35:16.346
you can check on your kid
via the real-time webcam app.

00:35:20.058 --> 00:35:21.560
- Here you go, sir.
- Right.

00:35:22.978 --> 00:35:25.022
SPECIAL MARTIAL ARTS YONGMU GYM
PROGRAM INFORMATION

00:35:25.105 --> 00:35:26.690
Kids seem to love you.

00:35:26.773 --> 00:35:28.567
Of course, they adore me.

00:35:29.985 --> 00:35:33.113
Please review it and let me know.

00:35:33.488 --> 00:35:36.325
Okay, I'll call you after I read it.

00:35:36.408 --> 00:35:37.993
Okay, thank you!

00:35:40.037 --> 00:35:41.622
MAMMOSEU MART

00:35:41.705 --> 00:35:43.373
Eat up. That's the way to go.

00:35:43.457 --> 00:35:46.001
- How much have you brought?
- So much.

00:35:46.084 --> 00:35:48.670
- She brought all kinds of stuff.
- My gosh.

00:35:48.754 --> 00:35:50.714
- Let's eat.
- Goodness.

00:35:51.506 --> 00:35:53.550
- Split it.
- It's hot. Let me do it.

00:35:54.259 --> 00:35:55.427
So hot!

00:35:57.929 --> 00:36:00.015
Min-seo's tutor is coming here later.

00:36:00.098 --> 00:36:03.060
- Myeong-o told me. Is it today?
- Yes.

00:36:03.226 --> 00:36:04.770
Is Myeong-o tutoring Min-seo?

00:36:04.853 --> 00:36:06.438
No, Myeong-o got a job.

00:36:06.521 --> 00:36:08.398
Not Myeong-o, but his friend.

00:36:09.691 --> 00:36:10.651
Hold on.

00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:14.905
He's Myeong-o's closest friend
from college.

00:36:14.988 --> 00:36:16.657
He must be so smart, then.

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.033
That's a new face.

00:36:19.284 --> 00:36:20.327
Is he new around here?

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:24.706
Hello.

00:36:25.624 --> 00:36:27.042
You're the insurance guy, right?

00:36:27.125 --> 00:36:28.126
Yes.

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:29.628
You live around here?

00:36:29.711 --> 00:36:32.005
- Yes, we just moved here yesterday.
- I see.

00:36:32.589 --> 00:36:33.840
How's your husband?

00:36:33.924 --> 00:36:37.177
He's totally fine.
He's out for deliveries.

00:36:37.886 --> 00:36:39.596
He should rest a bit.

00:36:41.974 --> 00:36:43.725
I'm glad he recovered so quickly!

00:36:45.435 --> 00:36:47.604
Hi, cutie, how old are you?

00:36:47.688 --> 00:36:48.939
I'm six.

00:36:49.022 --> 00:36:50.524
What a smart girl.

00:36:51.024 --> 00:36:53.402
My daughter was also smart
when she was six.

00:36:54.653 --> 00:36:56.321
Let's see.

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:59.741
Here. This is my welcome gift to you.

00:37:03.203 --> 00:37:05.789
It's okay. You can take gifts from me.

00:37:06.707 --> 00:37:07.916
Say, "Thank you."

00:37:08.792 --> 00:37:10.877
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:37:11.503 --> 00:37:14.631
The lady over there brought these corns.

00:37:14.715 --> 00:37:16.842
Have some. They're sweet.

00:37:16.925 --> 00:37:18.635
- Okay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:37:19.594 --> 00:37:20.762
Thank you.

00:37:20.846 --> 00:37:21.805
Let's go.

00:37:22.139 --> 00:37:23.598
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

00:37:24.099 --> 00:37:25.559
- Bye, cutie!
- Bye.

00:37:25.642 --> 00:37:27.227
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

00:37:27.311 --> 00:37:28.937
I should've had a daughter, too.

00:37:29.021 --> 00:37:30.522
It's not too late to have one now.

00:37:30.606 --> 00:37:31.773
Yes, it is.

00:37:31.857 --> 00:37:36.945
HARDWARE DREAM TREE STATIONERY

00:37:39.823 --> 00:37:43.160
We're only getting one, okay?

00:37:43.327 --> 00:37:44.870
You can't beg me for two.

00:37:45.037 --> 00:37:47.497
Okay, just one bunny sticker.

00:37:47.581 --> 00:37:49.416
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:37:49.499 --> 00:37:51.001
- Go.
- Go.

00:37:55.422 --> 00:37:57.049
Hello?

00:38:00.093 --> 00:38:02.012
Welcome.

00:38:02.929 --> 00:38:04.848
- What would you like?
- A bunny sticker, please.

00:38:04.931 --> 00:38:06.433
A bunny sticker?

00:38:06.516 --> 00:38:08.143
The stickers are here. Choose one.

00:38:08.226 --> 00:38:09.311
There they are.

00:38:13.857 --> 00:38:17.152
Do-yeon, I'm going to go
to the hardware store next door.

00:38:17.235 --> 00:38:19.196
- Choose your sticker and wait, okay?
- Okay.

00:38:19.613 --> 00:38:23.367
I'll watch her, so don't worry and go.

00:38:23.742 --> 00:38:25.535
- Okay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:38:25.619 --> 00:38:27.245
- I'll be right back.
- Sure.

00:38:30.332 --> 00:38:31.875
There you go.

00:38:31.959 --> 00:38:35.212
HARDWARE DREAM TREE STATIONERY

00:38:40.634 --> 00:38:41.885
Hello?

00:38:42.135 --> 00:38:44.012
Welcome.

00:38:44.471 --> 00:38:45.514
Hi, I'm...

00:38:50.852 --> 00:38:53.188
I just saw you! Are you twins?

00:38:53.271 --> 00:38:55.565
What a nightmare that'd be.

00:38:55.774 --> 00:38:58.527
The world doesn't need one more of this.

00:39:00.362 --> 00:39:01.363
Of course not.

00:39:06.201 --> 00:39:09.538
No, I don't mean
the world doesn't need one more of you.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.124
I was just laughing along.

00:39:14.293 --> 00:39:15.711
I don't know how I feel about that.

00:39:16.545 --> 00:39:17.713
Here.

00:39:19.881 --> 00:39:21.091
I run both stores.

00:39:22.759 --> 00:39:26.847
No wonder the sign read
"Hardware Dream Tree Stationery"!

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:27.889
Dream Tree in the middle,

00:39:27.973 --> 00:39:29.683
hardware on the left,
and stationery on the right!

00:39:29.766 --> 00:39:31.727
Something like that.

00:39:31.935 --> 00:39:32.894
What do you need?

00:39:33.729 --> 00:39:34.855
I need converter plugs.

00:39:35.314 --> 00:39:37.524
My wife loves to order things from abroad.

00:39:38.275 --> 00:39:40.902
Do you want the one with a lot of plugs?

00:39:40.986 --> 00:39:41.987
Yes, please.

00:39:43.363 --> 00:39:44.781
Let's see...

00:39:47.367 --> 00:39:49.202
Here. That'll be 15,000 won.

00:39:50.662 --> 00:39:51.705
What?

00:39:53.373 --> 00:39:56.627
But it's 7,000 won online.

00:39:58.837 --> 00:40:02.007
Even the recommended sales price
reads 12,000 won.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.262
That's just a recommendation.

00:40:07.346 --> 00:40:08.263
I sell things

00:40:09.056 --> 00:40:11.767
at my recommended prices.

00:40:11.933 --> 00:40:16.313
Instead, when you buy from me,
you get a lifetime warranty.

00:40:17.105 --> 00:40:19.733
Get one online if you don't like it.

00:40:23.612 --> 00:40:26.740
Okay, we have to trust our neighbors.

00:40:27.366 --> 00:40:28.742
My goodness, all right.

00:40:28.825 --> 00:40:30.494
Do you live in this area?

00:40:30.702 --> 00:40:32.454
Yes, I moved in just yesterday.

00:40:32.537 --> 00:40:33.538
I see.

00:40:34.289 --> 00:40:36.291
You moved in yesterday?

00:40:36.375 --> 00:40:38.418
Yes, in the apartment up there.

00:40:39.503 --> 00:40:41.463
In the apartment?

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:47.135
You can pay for everything next door.

00:40:47.844 --> 00:40:48.845
Sure.

00:40:55.227 --> 00:40:58.146
This is a present from me.

00:40:59.982 --> 00:41:02.192
It's the same as the one the lady gave me
at the grocery store.

00:41:02.734 --> 00:41:04.695
- Did she already give you one?
- Yes.

00:41:05.404 --> 00:41:07.698
Then let me make it two.

00:41:10.909 --> 00:41:12.244
It's all right. Take it.

00:41:12.703 --> 00:41:14.079
Thank you.

00:41:15.372 --> 00:41:17.040
- Have a good day.
- Thanks.

00:41:17.124 --> 00:41:18.542
- Let's go, Do-yeon.
- Okay.

00:41:19.543 --> 00:41:20.377
By the way,

00:41:24.172 --> 00:41:28.051
if you have broken toys or dolls,
you can bring them to me.

00:41:28.135 --> 00:41:29.678
I'll fix everything for you.

00:41:29.761 --> 00:41:31.847
Okay. Goodbye.

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:34.224
- See you around.
- Okay.

00:41:46.028 --> 00:41:48.071
MAMMOSEU MART

00:41:57.581 --> 00:41:59.124
What's this?

00:41:59.207 --> 00:42:00.334
Hello.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.379
Hello.

00:42:04.755 --> 00:42:07.382
Hey, Myeong-o.
Are you back from reservist training?

00:42:07.466 --> 00:42:10.135
Yes, and this is Jeong-hwan.

00:42:10.218 --> 00:42:12.095
Hello, I'm Park Jeong-hwan.

00:42:12.888 --> 00:42:14.264
Myeong-o has told me a lot about you.

00:42:15.182 --> 00:42:17.601
Adorable. I got lucky.

00:42:17.684 --> 00:42:19.353
- You can sit here.
- Okay.

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:20.979
- Call me when you're done.
- Thanks.

00:42:21.063 --> 00:42:22.189
- I'll get going, then.
- Okay.

00:42:22.272 --> 00:42:23.774
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:27.319
Honey, finish this up for me!

00:42:33.575 --> 00:42:34.409
Here.

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:41.083
Myeong-o didn't mention
how handsome you were.

00:42:42.709 --> 00:42:44.127
Thank you.

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.004
Gross, military uniform.

00:42:46.588 --> 00:42:47.923
It's gross for me, too.

00:42:49.299 --> 00:42:50.842
Don't talk to your teacher like that.

00:42:50.926 --> 00:42:53.178
I had to come
right after my reservist training.

00:42:54.179 --> 00:42:55.931
Maybe I should've changed.

00:42:56.014 --> 00:42:56.932
It's fine.

00:42:57.015 --> 00:42:59.351
Men who look good in uniforms
are really handsome.

00:42:59.434 --> 00:43:00.268
Thank you.

00:43:01.103 --> 00:43:01.937
"Handsome"?

00:43:02.604 --> 00:43:04.064
You couldn't pay me to wear that.

00:43:04.147 --> 00:43:06.483
Every Korean man
has worn military uniforms.

00:43:07.401 --> 00:43:09.695
Min-seo, why don't we start
with a simple level test?

00:43:09.778 --> 00:43:12.990
Can't we just start from the basics?
I'm unbelievably dumb.

00:43:13.782 --> 00:43:14.950
Wow, lucky you.

00:43:15.993 --> 00:43:19.496
She suddenly became so determined to study
just a few days ago.

00:43:19.579 --> 00:43:20.539
No idea why.

00:43:20.622 --> 00:43:23.125
I told you.
I'm going to become the next Sullivan.

00:43:23.208 --> 00:43:24.918
You know James Sullivan, right?

00:43:25.002 --> 00:43:28.213
Of course. I'm sure good things will come
if you work hard, too.

00:43:28.839 --> 00:43:29.798
That's true.

00:43:29.881 --> 00:43:32.884
She's starting from zero,
so if you can just stack some knowledge...

00:43:32.968 --> 00:43:34.469
Stop it, Mom.

00:43:34.553 --> 00:43:36.513
Honey, we have a foreign customer.

00:43:36.596 --> 00:43:37.681
Okay.

00:43:37.764 --> 00:43:39.766
- Please teach her well.
- I'll do my best.

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:41.101
- Okay.
- Thank you.

00:43:42.644 --> 00:43:44.813
Let's try working on this problem first.

00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:57.034
- Have some snacks at night, okay?
- Okay.

00:43:57.117 --> 00:43:59.077
Thank you for the snacks.

00:43:59.161 --> 00:44:01.872
I love how polite you are.

00:44:03.332 --> 00:44:04.625
Thanks for your work, even in the heat.

00:44:06.209 --> 00:44:07.419
Come back tomorrow.

00:44:07.502 --> 00:44:09.421
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:44:12.758 --> 00:44:14.176
Good work today.

00:44:15.469 --> 00:44:17.888
Hope you enjoy. See you.

00:44:17.971 --> 00:44:19.890
YOU HAVE A DIGITAL ASSET WAITING FOR YOU

00:44:21.975 --> 00:44:24.061
AMOUNT: 100,000,000 KRW
CLICK THE LINK TO RECEIVE THE TRANSFER

00:44:36.448 --> 00:44:38.367
- Are clouds blue?
- I think so.

00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:45.582
SURGE IN CORPORATE PURCHASES,
CONCERNS OVER OVERHEATING PROPERTY MARKET

00:44:45.666 --> 00:44:48.377
Some are commenting
about the high demand for investments...

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:52.005
The boss complimented you earlier today

00:44:52.089 --> 00:44:54.049
for buying a home
in the hottest area at the time.

00:44:54.675 --> 00:44:56.635
He's envious of me
for having such a smart wife.

00:44:57.844 --> 00:45:02.307
So, I got mad and corrected him.

00:45:04.977 --> 00:45:07.062
Because you're not just smart.

00:45:07.562 --> 00:45:10.315
You're the smartest wife.

00:45:11.358 --> 00:45:12.609
Lucky you.

00:45:13.402 --> 00:45:16.196
I'd love to meet a smart husband
and live a happy life, too.

00:45:18.448 --> 00:45:20.867
I know you're happy to live with me.

00:45:20.993 --> 00:45:22.661
See? Money isn't everything.

00:45:23.078 --> 00:45:26.248
Talk to me after you check your salary.

00:45:27.332 --> 00:45:30.544
How can I check that? You get my salary.

00:45:30.919 --> 00:45:33.338
My heart is too frail to check it,
isn't that right?

00:45:33.422 --> 00:45:35.173
- Your heart isn't weak.
- Next story.

00:45:35.799 --> 00:45:39.678
The case of Charlotte Sullivan's death
on the outskirts of Kiyun-si

00:45:39.761 --> 00:45:42.889
is scheduled for the final verdict
by the Supreme Court tomorrow.

00:45:43.181 --> 00:45:46.768
Details of the case are again receiving
widespread attention.

00:45:46.977 --> 00:45:49.396
- The verdict is still not out?
- At the time,

00:45:49.479 --> 00:45:50.772
he was on a military mission,

00:45:50.856 --> 00:45:52.983
- and his blood alcohol level showed
- That won't affect our area, right?

00:45:53.066 --> 00:45:55.235
- that he was sober,
- Be quiet.

00:45:55.319 --> 00:45:57.112
AUG 2005: D-1 UNTIL THE FINAL VERDICT
so he was declared innocent.

00:45:57.195 --> 00:45:59.740
CEO James Sullivan demanded

00:45:59.823 --> 00:46:03.035
further investigations
on the driver and his fault--

00:46:06.246 --> 00:46:08.624
If the specialized IT zone plan
is scrapped,

00:46:08.707 --> 00:46:10.792
so will all plans to redevelop this area.

00:46:12.919 --> 00:46:15.505
- You know what that means, right?
- I do. It'll work out.

00:46:16.798 --> 00:46:18.675
We need to look for
Do-yeon's after-class program, too.

00:46:18.967 --> 00:46:20.344
It's a shame
there aren't any ballet studios around.

00:46:20.427 --> 00:46:21.970
- I don't like ballet.
- Why not?

00:46:22.054 --> 00:46:23.847
You got a new leotard and shoes.

00:46:24.139 --> 00:46:26.224
I'll sign her up
for an after-class program.

00:46:26.308 --> 00:46:28.852
You're busy, so don't worry about it.

00:46:30.646 --> 00:46:33.106
Do-yeon, let's brush your teeth
if you're done with that.

00:46:33.315 --> 00:46:36.818
Brush up, down, left, and right

00:46:37.611 --> 00:46:38.695
Let's go.

00:46:40.364 --> 00:46:41.448
Come on.

00:46:41.949 --> 00:46:44.701
- Off we go.
- Off we go.

00:46:46.036 --> 00:46:48.622
Honey! Garbage!

00:46:50.082 --> 00:46:52.751
Did you just call me garbage?

00:46:59.049 --> 00:47:00.509
I'll put Do-yeon to bed first.

00:47:01.677 --> 00:47:06.098
"There were colorful, sweet lollipops
hidden in the reeds.

00:47:06.181 --> 00:47:08.308
'But I promised not to eat candy.'

00:47:08.392 --> 00:47:10.727
'I promised my siblings.'"

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:26.159
- Dad.
- Yes?

00:47:30.289 --> 00:47:32.082
I want to learn martial arts.

00:47:35.335 --> 00:47:37.879
I'll sign you up for it.

00:47:39.172 --> 00:47:41.842
Promise to protect me, okay?

00:47:54.771 --> 00:47:59.318
He didn't recycle anything
and just tossed a black bag out.

00:47:59.401 --> 00:48:00.986
Look at this.

00:48:01.069 --> 00:48:02.946
And that smell.

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:07.451
How dare he piss off
our youth association president?

00:48:07.534 --> 00:48:11.079
I'm going to find who it is
and make sure he pays a hefty fine.

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:15.250
You can usually tell who it is
just by the knot on the bags.

00:48:15.334 --> 00:48:16.627
Can't you tell this time?

00:48:20.714 --> 00:48:21.548
Hear me out.

00:48:22.966 --> 00:48:26.303
Our neighbors collectively agreed
not to use black bags for recycling.

00:48:26.386 --> 00:48:27.387
Right.

00:48:27.554 --> 00:48:30.140
- But this guy used a black bag.
- Yes?

00:48:31.767 --> 00:48:34.895
I'm sure I'll find a clue
if I continue patrolling.

00:48:34.978 --> 00:48:37.522
I'll make sure I find who it is.

00:48:37.606 --> 00:48:41.526
Whoever it is, the poor guy will die
in our Byeong-nam's hands.

00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:42.945
Go easy, okay?

00:49:03.757 --> 00:49:07.594
NO LITTERING
UNDER SURVEILLANCE 24 HOURS A DAY

00:49:07.678 --> 00:49:09.221
Plastic.

00:49:11.556 --> 00:49:14.351
Cans.

00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:25.279
What are you doing there?

00:49:30.284 --> 00:49:31.451
Ma'am?

00:49:34.955 --> 00:49:37.374
A bunny died.

00:49:38.917 --> 00:49:40.627
Your pet bunny died?

00:49:51.096 --> 00:49:52.639
This bunny?

00:49:52.931 --> 00:49:53.765
Hey, stop!

00:49:54.308 --> 00:49:55.392
My gosh!

00:49:55.475 --> 00:49:58.186
Of course you're scared.
Because I caught you red-handed.

00:49:58.270 --> 00:49:59.521
Excuse me, ma'am.

00:50:00.188 --> 00:50:01.106
My, my!

00:50:02.065 --> 00:50:03.275
Another stuffed bunny?

00:50:07.571 --> 00:50:08.947
Unit 307.

00:50:09.031 --> 00:50:11.617
- Hello, sir!
- Hello.

00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:13.201
Look at this.

00:50:13.702 --> 00:50:14.828
Honey.

00:50:15.579 --> 00:50:18.290
Why are you here? You should be in bed.

00:50:18.373 --> 00:50:20.959
Was it you, ma'am?
What are you doing here?

00:50:21.877 --> 00:50:25.130
Killed the poor bunny...

00:50:25.213 --> 00:50:26.256
Who?

00:50:27.466 --> 00:50:29.760
- This guy?
- No.

00:50:29.843 --> 00:50:33.597
She was looking into this bag,
so I asked what she was doing,

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:35.974
and she said the bunny was dead. Right?

00:50:39.019 --> 00:50:39.978
Who are you?

00:50:42.564 --> 00:50:44.691
Are you the new neighbor
in the next building?

00:50:46.985 --> 00:50:48.236
What are you doing here?

00:50:49.112 --> 00:50:51.239
You said you were going on a patrol.

00:50:52.658 --> 00:50:54.910
Yes, I'm back now.

00:50:55.494 --> 00:50:57.204
Did you come to get me?

00:50:57.496 --> 00:50:59.873
- Let's head in.
- Okay.

00:50:59.957 --> 00:51:01.541
- Bye, then.
- We'll head in.

00:51:01.625 --> 00:51:05.087
- Goodnight.
- I told you to stay in.

00:51:05.963 --> 00:51:07.339
Let's head in.

00:51:08.924 --> 00:51:11.426
Her symptoms are pretty serious.

00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:16.431
Is she unwell?

00:51:20.894 --> 00:51:22.312
No, my point is,

00:51:23.063 --> 00:51:26.108
she's not the type
to play with a stuffed bunny,

00:51:26.191 --> 00:51:29.319
and she's also not the type
to toss trash just anywhere.

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.322
Yes, even I could tell that.

00:51:34.616 --> 00:51:37.119
Are you suspecting me right now?

00:51:37.786 --> 00:51:39.538
If it's not you, who would it be?

00:51:40.122 --> 00:51:43.041
Are you kidding me? Do you know who I am?

00:51:43.125 --> 00:51:44.668
Do I need to know that
to get recycling done?

00:51:44.751 --> 00:51:47.212
Do I seem like the type to cut open
a stuffed animal's belly?

00:51:47.296 --> 00:51:48.297
How did you know about the belly?

00:51:48.588 --> 00:51:50.757
Because I just saw it!

00:51:50.841 --> 00:51:52.592
- This is...
- Okay.

00:51:52.676 --> 00:51:53.760
Look at it again.

00:52:01.435 --> 00:52:03.145
What is it? What's wrong?

00:52:05.147 --> 00:52:08.317
I think there's cat hair inside.
I'm allergic.

00:52:10.527 --> 00:52:11.945
There's no cat hair.

00:52:12.988 --> 00:52:14.364
You're allergic?

00:52:14.865 --> 00:52:17.075
That's too bad.

00:52:17.159 --> 00:52:18.785
Oh, no.

00:52:20.037 --> 00:52:22.497
You'd better recycle properly from now on.

00:52:22.581 --> 00:52:25.334
I'm watching you, okay?

00:52:26.335 --> 00:52:27.544
Seriously.

00:52:34.635 --> 00:52:36.386
Why do you keep following me?

00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:38.055
Who? Me?

00:52:38.138 --> 00:52:39.973
I'm just going home this way.

00:52:40.057 --> 00:52:42.684
Why are you walking this way
when you live there?

00:52:43.393 --> 00:52:44.519
Out of guilt?

00:52:44.603 --> 00:52:46.229
Guilt for what?

00:52:46.313 --> 00:52:48.398
I'm just going to the convenience store
to get cigarettes.

00:52:48.482 --> 00:52:51.902
Remember, cigarettes go in regular waste.

00:52:51.985 --> 00:52:54.363
It's a 50,000-won fine
if you discard it on the streets.

00:52:54.446 --> 00:52:56.239
In some cases, they even arrest you.

00:52:56.323 --> 00:52:59.034
Why are you following me around
and nagging me? What did I do?

00:53:00.118 --> 00:53:01.870
You know,

00:53:02.287 --> 00:53:04.665
it's just that I found two black bags
of tattered stuffed bunnies,

00:53:04.748 --> 00:53:07.876
once in the morning, and once at night.

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:10.128
And you just happened
to move in yesterday.

00:53:10.587 --> 00:53:12.673
And both were spotted
at the dumpster near your building.

00:53:12.965 --> 00:53:16.343
Even more, you had the second bag
in your own hands.

00:53:16.426 --> 00:53:18.303
And you have a kid
who has stuffed animals.

00:53:18.679 --> 00:53:20.347
Isn't that suspicious?

00:53:20.973 --> 00:53:24.559
If it isn't, what in the world is?

00:53:24.893 --> 00:53:26.061
Goodness.

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:30.065
You're crazy. You're out of your mind.

00:53:31.233 --> 00:53:33.902
If you want to suspect someone,
bring evidence.

00:53:33.986 --> 00:53:35.445
But you wouldn't be able to get any.

00:53:35.529 --> 00:53:37.406
Why? Because I didn't do it.

00:53:39.783 --> 00:53:42.286
Why am I even explaining this to you?

00:53:44.204 --> 00:53:45.580
Maybe you're guilty.

00:53:59.845 --> 00:54:02.472
What? My gosh, what are you doing?

00:54:02.973 --> 00:54:04.975
- It's him.
- Who?

00:54:05.058 --> 00:54:06.893
The man who just left the store.

00:54:06.977 --> 00:54:08.478
He was at the dumpster earlier.

00:54:08.562 --> 00:54:10.355
- Let's go and ask him.
- Ask him what?

00:54:10.439 --> 00:54:13.525
He would've seen me get there later!

00:54:15.110 --> 00:54:16.987
Hey, wait.

00:54:17.321 --> 00:54:18.447
- Hey!
- Run!

00:54:23.702 --> 00:54:26.079
Excuse me, can I talk to you?

00:54:27.956 --> 00:54:29.124
I need to ask you something.

00:54:32.127 --> 00:54:33.086
What?

00:54:34.421 --> 00:54:36.840
What is it? What?

00:54:37.507 --> 00:54:40.010
Hey! I'm not dangerous or anything!

00:54:41.386 --> 00:54:42.304
Sir.

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:44.806
You're kidding.

00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:46.683
Hey, wait!

00:54:47.768 --> 00:54:48.894
Be careful!

00:54:56.318 --> 00:54:57.694
What did he just do?

00:54:58.570 --> 00:54:59.404
Darn it.

00:55:09.998 --> 00:55:12.501
How can he run so well in sliders?

00:55:12.584 --> 00:55:14.294
It's way too late for this nonsense.

00:55:28.433 --> 00:55:29.518
Excuse me!

00:55:29.601 --> 00:55:31.478
Stop right there!

00:55:33.647 --> 00:55:35.941
- Sir!
- Why is he so damn fast?

00:55:37.359 --> 00:55:38.277
Hey!

00:55:41.488 --> 00:55:42.489
Excuse me!

00:55:43.407 --> 00:55:44.408
Darn it!

00:55:44.908 --> 00:55:46.493
It's uphill from there.

00:55:50.163 --> 00:55:50.998
Excuse me!

00:55:52.374 --> 00:55:53.208
Hey!

00:56:00.632 --> 00:56:02.092
Oh, my. Sir!

00:56:02.175 --> 00:56:04.136
- Out of my way!
- Sir!

00:56:10.934 --> 00:56:14.730
I just want to ask you something! Stop it!

00:56:24.156 --> 00:56:25.532
Darn it!

00:56:29.161 --> 00:56:30.037
Hey!

00:56:30.954 --> 00:56:31.913
Sir!

00:56:33.457 --> 00:56:34.458
Excuse me!

00:56:35.542 --> 00:56:36.418
Excuse me!

00:56:38.962 --> 00:56:39.838
Sir!

00:56:56.772 --> 00:56:57.773
Where did he go?

00:56:58.607 --> 00:57:00.692
Where is he?

00:57:02.986 --> 00:57:04.029
Sir!

00:57:04.529 --> 00:57:06.073
Are you kidding me right now?

00:57:06.156 --> 00:57:07.074
Excuse me!

00:57:08.617 --> 00:57:10.243
My gosh!

00:57:11.828 --> 00:57:13.413
There's nowhere else for you to go.

00:57:13.664 --> 00:57:14.831
This is the rooftop.

00:57:40.023 --> 00:57:41.942
I just wanted to ask you something!

00:57:42.025 --> 00:57:43.860
Why do you keep running away?

00:57:43.944 --> 00:57:45.737
My gosh, my sliders are all ruined.

00:57:52.869 --> 00:57:54.037
MK2?

00:57:59.251 --> 00:58:01.169
Who are you? That's dangerous.

00:58:10.637 --> 00:58:11.638
Are you a foreigner?

00:58:50.135 --> 00:58:51.595
My goodness!

00:58:53.764 --> 00:58:56.350
Man! My heart is about to burst.

00:58:56.975 --> 00:58:58.101
Where did he go?

00:58:58.352 --> 00:59:00.354
- That way.
- That way?

00:59:01.563 --> 00:59:03.899
You said you had something to ask him.
Did you ask him?

00:59:07.402 --> 00:59:08.278
Did you get into a fight?

00:59:10.364 --> 00:59:11.531
Oh, yes.

00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:14.076
He went that way,
but I don't see him anymore.

00:59:15.035 --> 00:59:16.453
I'd better go home.

00:59:18.038 --> 00:59:19.039
That's the main road.

00:59:20.916 --> 00:59:22.042
What?

00:59:22.125 --> 00:59:23.627
It's a long detour.

00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:25.629
This way is faster.

00:59:25.963 --> 00:59:28.215
You can't lead the way
when you know nothing.

00:59:29.299 --> 00:59:31.176
Why didn't you come sooner
if you knew your way so well?

00:59:31.259 --> 00:59:33.428
You came after everything,
and here you are, boasting.

00:59:33.679 --> 00:59:36.056
I ran as fast as I could, too.

00:59:37.933 --> 00:59:40.435
Follow me or go the long way.

00:59:41.895 --> 00:59:43.105
My knees are killing me.

00:59:50.279 --> 00:59:51.196
Wait for me.

01:00:34.698 --> 01:00:38.702
Did you hear a gunshot? With a muffler.

01:00:39.244 --> 01:00:40.329
A gunshot?

01:00:40.704 --> 01:00:44.333
Why are you so startled?
We see guns all the time in the army.

01:00:45.042 --> 01:00:46.335
I was exempt from service.

01:00:47.419 --> 01:00:48.754
No wonder.

01:00:49.671 --> 01:00:50.839
You're so out of it.

01:00:51.465 --> 01:00:54.551
Out of what? I was much faster than you.

01:00:54.635 --> 01:00:57.054
Why were you exempt from service
if you were so fast, then?

01:00:57.512 --> 01:01:00.849
You couldn't even catch that tiny guy,
and you're a mess.

01:01:01.099 --> 01:01:02.851
You could've just gone in, and...

01:01:05.187 --> 01:01:06.897
This was all you needed to do.

01:01:07.314 --> 01:01:09.733
You don't know how to do this
because you didn't serve in the army.

01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:12.861
What are you, five years old?

01:01:12.986 --> 01:01:16.156
Why are you being so rude?

01:01:16.782 --> 01:01:20.285
I just can't talk to men
who haven't served.

01:01:34.299 --> 01:01:37.678
JOWOONG BANK

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:42.516
What is he doing?

01:01:44.977 --> 01:01:46.311
What is it now?

01:01:51.566 --> 01:01:53.360
ENTER YOUR PASSCODE

01:01:53.443 --> 01:01:54.444
CHOOSE YOUR TRANSACTION

01:01:54.528 --> 01:01:56.905
AMOUNT: 101,571,879 WON

01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:08.333
- What are you looking at?
- My gosh!

01:02:08.417 --> 01:02:10.502
Why are you zoning out here alone?

01:02:10.585 --> 01:02:13.046
Aren't you going to go home?
Don't follow me, and go home.

01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:14.131
Just go.

01:02:14.214 --> 01:02:17.134
Why do you care about where I go?

01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:19.678
You keep getting more and more suspicious.

01:02:20.929 --> 01:02:21.763
What now?

01:02:23.515 --> 01:02:25.976
Hey, it's him.

01:02:26.059 --> 01:02:28.437
- It's him, isn't he?
- No.

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:31.148
I'll go in alone and talk to him.
Good work tonight.

01:02:31.231 --> 01:02:32.858
- You can go.
- What? We can go together.

01:02:32.941 --> 01:02:35.652
No, I told you to go! Just leave!

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:40.782
You think you can tell me what to do?

01:02:41.366 --> 01:02:43.243
I'm the youth association president
in this neighborhood.

01:02:43.994 --> 01:02:46.038
Hey! What a ridiculous guy.

01:02:46.121 --> 01:02:47.289
Just go!

01:02:47.372 --> 01:02:48.874
ENTER THE RECIPIENT ACCOUNT NUMBER

01:02:48.957 --> 01:02:50.042
I told you to leave!

01:02:50.125 --> 01:02:51.376
You said we should go ask him!

01:02:56.923 --> 01:02:58.175
I told you to leave!

01:02:58.258 --> 01:02:59.718
Let's go together!

01:03:15.859 --> 01:03:16.735
Watch out!

01:03:56.441 --> 01:04:02.447
SECOND EXPLOSION
ON AUG 17, 2025 AT 12:30 A.M.

01:04:11.248 --> 01:04:14.418
What exploded, Officer Park?

01:04:15.002 --> 01:04:16.461
Please just go to bed.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:20.590
I was just crossing the street
when it exploded

01:04:20.674 --> 01:04:22.134
and threw me to the ground.

01:04:22.551 --> 01:04:24.803
I was too shocked to notice anything.

01:04:25.429 --> 01:04:27.639
Yes, you can ask that guy.

01:04:29.975 --> 01:04:31.059
Let me sanitize your wound.

01:04:33.312 --> 01:04:34.855
I haven't done anything.

01:04:35.564 --> 01:04:37.024
It hurts so much.

01:04:37.107 --> 01:04:39.151
Just the smell of it makes it sting.

01:04:42.195 --> 01:04:44.948
- I'd like to ask you some questions.
- Sure.

01:04:45.032 --> 01:04:47.784
Do you remember anything
about the man inside?

01:04:49.995 --> 01:04:52.998
He was a foreigner.
Maybe Southeast Asian...

01:04:53.832 --> 01:04:56.835
No, South American? Or Russian?

01:04:56.918 --> 01:04:59.379
I'm not sure about his exact ethnicity.

01:04:59.463 --> 01:05:02.966
I needed to ask him something,
so I tried to talk to him.

01:05:03.050 --> 01:05:06.345
But he kept glancing at me
before running away.

01:05:06.428 --> 01:05:09.681
I wondered why he was running,
so I ran after him.

01:05:09.765 --> 01:05:13.560
But the man suddenly started
waving a knife at me!

01:05:13.644 --> 01:05:15.646
- A knife?
- Yes!

01:05:15.729 --> 01:05:17.689
It was a knife at first,
but then, he whipped out a gun...

01:05:18.357 --> 01:05:19.274
A gun?

01:05:24.321 --> 01:05:28.951
I mean, he whipped out his big guns
and started pounding on me.

01:05:29.826 --> 01:05:31.286
Then he ran away.

01:05:31.995 --> 01:05:36.124
Did you see what he was doing
in the ATM booth?

01:05:36.208 --> 01:05:37.542
Well...

01:05:45.133 --> 01:05:46.093
Military boots?

01:05:47.135 --> 01:05:50.305
He was probably withdrawing some money.

01:05:54.893 --> 01:05:56.812
ARMY18 8285

01:05:56.895 --> 01:05:58.063
A military van?

01:06:06.196 --> 01:06:07.239
Soldiers?

01:06:47.362 --> 01:06:50.282
HEROES NEXT DOOR

01:06:50.365 --> 01:06:54.870
The guilty always return to the scene.

01:06:54.953 --> 01:06:56.163
What is this place?

01:06:56.246 --> 01:06:58.624
He took the damaged car
and drove toward Hanbal Mountain.

01:06:58.707 --> 01:07:01.293
A butane gas explosion caused a death.

01:07:01.376 --> 01:07:03.003
Butane gas? Are you serious?

01:07:03.086 --> 01:07:04.421
I can't stand this!

01:07:04.504 --> 01:07:06.298
They're trying to cover this up.

01:07:06.381 --> 01:07:09.259
There's something going on here.

01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:12.429
So he's a secret agent for the NIS?

01:07:13.263 --> 01:07:14.723
I think Choi Kang is

01:07:16.016 --> 01:07:17.309
a North Korean spy.

01:07:18.977 --> 01:07:20.979
