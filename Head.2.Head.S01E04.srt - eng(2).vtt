What were you thinking,

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:16.245
making your crush your roommate?

00:00:16.388 --> 00:00:17.111
You know?

00:00:19.174 --> 00:00:20.618
Farm’s a very good person.

00:00:20.741 --> 00:00:23.331
Mess with whoever you want,
just not with friends.

00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:25.179
I promise I won’t hurt him.

00:00:26.487 --> 00:00:29.382
How come I’ve never
seen this notebook before?

00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:30.651
How would you?

00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:33.993
I hid it in my underwear drawer.

00:00:42.117 --> 00:00:48.819
BEING THIS CLOSE TO YOU...
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO STOP MYSELF
FROM FEELING SOMETHING FOR YOU?

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.984
You prick. Why are you touching my stuff?!

00:00:56.984 --> 00:00:57.484
Jinn.

00:00:57.484 --> 00:00:59.080
What the hell’s wrong with you?
It’s my personal stuff!

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.368
Just go home!

00:01:00.368 --> 00:01:01.051
Damn it.

00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:02.212
Jinn!

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:03.622
Hear me out first.

00:01:03.928 --> 00:01:05.129
No. Let go of me.

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:06.003
Hear me out!

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:06.719
Hands off me!

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:07.837
Just listen.

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:11.725
Do you still like me?

00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:19.027
- Damn it.
- Jinn!

00:01:19.231 --> 00:01:19.914
Get off me!

00:01:20.527 --> 00:01:21.234
Ouch.

00:01:32.547 --> 00:01:33.700
Can we talk, Jinn?

00:03:26.908 --> 00:03:27.981
I’ll talk to my mom.

00:03:28.553 --> 00:03:29.475
You can start packing.

00:03:41.605 --> 00:03:42.323
You know?

00:03:42.732 --> 00:03:45.341
If you’re yelling at me,
laughing at me, teasing me,

00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:47.452
it’s still better than you staying quiet like this.

00:03:49.413 --> 00:03:50.844
I just don’t know what to say.

00:03:51.886 --> 00:03:53.113
Then do what I said.

00:03:53.705 --> 00:03:55.693
Pack your stuff and get out of my place.

00:03:57.491 --> 00:03:59.107
Why didn’t you tell me anything?

00:04:00.374 --> 00:04:01.059
Tell you?

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.435
What would I even tell you?

00:04:02.782 --> 00:04:04.071
Anything.

00:04:04.582 --> 00:04:06.173
Anything you wanted to say.

00:04:06.316 --> 00:04:08.228
Whatever you’re feeling.

00:04:08.473 --> 00:04:09.791
Not pushing me away like this.

00:04:10.118 --> 00:04:11.364
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:13.683
Have you forgotten that
you don’t want to be here?

00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:15.963
We don’t have to listen to our moms.

00:04:15.963 --> 00:04:17.302
We’re grownups.

00:04:17.302 --> 00:04:18.582
Why should we let them force us?

00:04:26.019 --> 00:04:26.982
How did you find it anyway?

00:04:28.126 --> 00:04:28.826
No.

00:04:29.337 --> 00:04:30.070
You went through my stuff…

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.293
(How come I’ve never
seen this notebook before?)

00:04:32.293 --> 00:04:34.446
- (How would you?)
- You’re such a creep.

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:37.720
I hid it in my underwear drawer.

00:04:40.662 --> 00:04:42.273
If you came across it, that’d be weird.

00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:43.784
Why would you go through
my underwear drawer?

00:04:43.907 --> 00:04:45.081
(Answer me.)

00:04:45.204 --> 00:04:46.145
You’re right.

00:04:46.247 --> 00:04:47.167
(Why did you do it?)

00:04:47.494 --> 00:04:48.865
Well, answer me!

00:04:49.927 --> 00:04:51.620
Why did you go through
my underwear drawer?

00:04:51.865 --> 00:04:53.242
Can we talk about something else first?

00:04:53.487 --> 00:04:55.992
You’re dragging this,
beating around the f*cking bush.

00:04:55.992 --> 00:04:57.287
Just know that I’m sorry.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.533
I’m sorry for messing with your things.

00:05:01.758 --> 00:05:04.122
But please calm down and talk to me nicely.

00:05:05.859 --> 00:05:06.923
What is there to talk about?

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:09.853
Just yell at me or tease me.

00:05:10.446 --> 00:05:11.504
There’s nothing to talk about.

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:13.063
And why would I do that?

00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:14.705
You’ve always done that.

00:05:15.297 --> 00:05:18.260
You right now don’t seem like yourself at all.

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:21.818
Forget it.

00:05:23.187 --> 00:05:25.792
If you want to amend,

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.703
just act like you never saw this notebook.

00:05:33.094 --> 00:05:34.227
I can do that

00:05:37.046 --> 00:05:38.431
if it means I can keep staying here.

00:05:40.801 --> 00:05:41.683
What the heck?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.014
I don’t want to move out.

00:05:43.913 --> 00:05:45.150
I want to live here.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:49.967
I want to live with you.

00:05:54.968 --> 00:05:55.696
Gosh.

00:05:56.472 --> 00:05:57.507
I hate you.

00:06:26.641 --> 00:06:28.149
Give me your hand. I’ll dress your wound.

00:06:32.153 --> 00:06:34.520
You’re going to dress my wound?

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:37.969
Because you went nuts
and refused to go to the hospital today.

00:06:39.297 --> 00:06:40.591
I’ll clean it my way for now.

00:06:40.591 --> 00:06:41.886
You can have it done properly tomorrow.

00:06:43.316 --> 00:06:44.817
Today! Get up.

00:07:10.706 --> 00:07:11.483
Does it hurt more?

00:07:12.443 --> 00:07:13.128
What?

00:07:15.253 --> 00:07:19.867
I pushed you
and your hand hit the wardrobe.

00:07:20.684 --> 00:07:21.838
You made a face like it hurt.

00:07:24.351 --> 00:07:25.632
You worried about me?

00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:28.844
In your f*cking dreams.

00:07:29.314 --> 00:07:31.419
I’m just asking out of basic human morality.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.118
If you don’t want to answer, then don’t.

00:07:48.285 --> 00:07:49.421
And rest assured.

00:07:49.768 --> 00:07:53.021
I asked my senior friend,
who’s a doctor, how to do this.

00:07:55.248 --> 00:07:58.188
Tomorrow, get it cleaned before uni.

00:08:00.266 --> 00:08:01.096
It didn’t hurt, did it?

00:08:02.669 --> 00:08:03.276
No.

00:08:03.766 --> 00:08:04.394
Good.

00:08:04.762 --> 00:08:05.302
Get some sleep.

00:08:06.344 --> 00:08:07.651
I’ll take a shower.

00:08:09.612 --> 00:08:10.824
- Jinn.
- Hm?

00:08:11.192 --> 00:08:14.090
You have a senior friend who’s a doctor?

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:14.590
Mm.

00:08:14.937 --> 00:08:15.699
Do I know them?

00:08:16.148 --> 00:08:16.828
Yeah.

00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:17.936
It’s Pim.

00:08:20.122 --> 00:08:21.444
Pim?

00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:24.406
Isn’t she a veterinarian?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.927
Jinn, you dickhead.

00:08:27.765 --> 00:08:28.398
Damn it.

00:08:55.206 --> 00:08:56.801
Hey, hey, hey.

00:08:56.964 --> 00:08:58.310
Help me pick. Which one is it?

00:08:58.433 --> 00:08:59.809
One or two?

00:09:00.851 --> 00:09:01.665
Where are you going?

00:09:02.155 --> 00:09:03.228
A friend’s birthday party.

00:09:03.698 --> 00:09:04.404
The black one.

00:09:04.567 --> 00:09:05.157
Thought so too.

00:09:09.113 --> 00:09:09.834
Van!

00:09:10.468 --> 00:09:11.767
Why don’t you change in the bathroom?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.450
As if you’ve never changed
in front of your friends.

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:25.737
What about perfume?

00:09:26.922 --> 00:09:27.611
Which one?

00:09:27.897 --> 00:09:29.495
Don’t you already have your usual now?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.237
Use that.

00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:32.610
I just bought this new one.

00:09:33.182 --> 00:09:34.221
It smells nice too.

00:09:35.672 --> 00:09:37.446
Smell them both and see.

00:09:40.307 --> 00:09:40.952
This is the old one.

00:09:44.527 --> 00:09:45.171
So?

00:09:45.763 --> 00:09:48.190
I think the old one is already nice.

00:09:49.804 --> 00:09:53.313
You just love sticking to the same old stuff.

00:09:53.742 --> 00:09:55.019
Well, I already like it.

00:09:55.857 --> 00:09:56.982
What can I do?

00:10:02.621 --> 00:10:04.433
Tonight, you can just head to bed.

00:10:04.556 --> 00:10:05.202
Don’t wait up.

00:10:05.651 --> 00:10:06.197
Mm.

00:10:06.401 --> 00:10:08.123
If you’re drunk, call me. I’ll pick you up.

00:10:11.188 --> 00:10:12.279
Damn it.

00:10:12.504 --> 00:10:13.919
Don’t you ever date anyone.

00:10:16.514 --> 00:10:17.552
What are you talking about?

00:10:19.125 --> 00:10:20.608
Because once you get a partner,

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.497
I’m going to be so jealous of them.

00:10:31.955 --> 00:10:33.242
I’m heading out now, babe.

00:10:34.059 --> 00:10:34.755
Bye.

00:10:46.465 --> 00:10:48.087
How could I do that?

00:10:49.476 --> 00:10:50.513
I can’t.

00:11:13.615 --> 00:11:14.305
J.

00:11:20.381 --> 00:11:21.163
Jinn.

00:11:21.653 --> 00:11:22.672
Open your eyes.

00:11:22.672 --> 00:11:24.597
Jinn, wake up.

00:11:25.516 --> 00:11:27.242
Jinn, open your eyes.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:28.761
Jinn.

00:11:31.703 --> 00:11:33.002
Jinn, wake up.

00:11:43.624 --> 00:11:44.324
J!

00:11:49.752 --> 00:11:50.604
J, are you alright?

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:12.603
J, what’s wrong?

00:12:22.256 --> 00:12:23.329
Are you okay?

00:12:26.353 --> 00:12:28.411
I should be the one asking you that.

00:12:37.175 --> 00:12:39.453
I… I’m sorry.

00:12:42.885 --> 00:12:43.751
It’s nothing.

00:12:44.241 --> 00:12:46.874
You can go to bed.

00:12:52.349 --> 00:12:55.182
I think… if we try to sleep now,

00:12:56.449 --> 00:12:58.031
we’ll just end up staring
at the ceiling until dawn.

00:13:09.566 --> 00:13:10.525
Does it bother you…

00:13:11.403 --> 00:13:13.967
knowing I still have feelings for you?

00:13:35.531 --> 00:13:37.079
We’re sitting out here
getting eaten by mosquitoes.

00:13:38.273 --> 00:13:40.694
How is this any different
from staring at the ceiling?

00:13:45.525 --> 00:13:46.894
Don’t you have anything to say to me?

00:13:49.836 --> 00:13:50.911
Not right now.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:55.585
Can I ask you something?

00:13:56.904 --> 00:13:57.404
Mm.

00:14:00.542 --> 00:14:01.530
Does it bother you…

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:04.782
knowing I still have feelings for you?

00:14:08.294 --> 00:14:09.046
Jinn…

00:14:10.383 --> 00:14:12.982
Don’t overthink about me.

00:14:12.982 --> 00:14:13.823
Don’t get confused.

00:14:14.465 --> 00:14:16.605
I’ve lived with this feeling
for more than ten years.

00:14:17.675 --> 00:14:19.621
So don’t worry.

00:14:21.047 --> 00:14:23.236
I won’t burden you with my feelings.

00:14:32.526 --> 00:14:33.910
You must be wondering

00:14:35.301 --> 00:14:36.799
why I’m hugging you right now.

00:14:41.292 --> 00:14:43.065
Please don’t ask anything yet,

00:14:45.507 --> 00:14:50.140
because I can’t figure out the answer myself.

00:14:53.492 --> 00:14:54.570
Give me time.

00:14:55.782 --> 00:14:57.170
Once I’m sure…

00:14:59.577 --> 00:15:01.687
you’ll be the first to know.

00:15:11.964 --> 00:15:12.661
Shit.

00:15:14.907 --> 00:15:16.357
Why am I letting you hug me

00:15:17.373 --> 00:15:20.460
when I should be kicking you off your chair?

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:41.605
Damn it.

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.947
What exactly happened to us?

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.171
So what just happened there?

00:15:54.171 --> 00:15:54.799
A bad dream?

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.202
Ever since the accident at the racetrack,

00:16:01.608 --> 00:16:02.863
I haven’t had a proper night’s sleep.

00:16:04.218 --> 00:16:06.069
I keep dreaming about all sorts of things.

00:16:09.278 --> 00:16:10.099
Are they all bad dreams?

00:16:12.007 --> 00:16:12.735
Not really.

00:16:14.892 --> 00:16:18.150
Sometimes good. Sometimes bad.

00:16:19.024 --> 00:16:20.482
Sometimes weird.

00:16:21.463 --> 00:16:25.480
Sometimes just basic daily stuff.

00:16:28.903 --> 00:16:31.999
Can you give me some examples?

00:16:34.245 --> 00:16:36.100
They’re just ordinary things.

00:16:37.669 --> 00:16:39.017
What’s weird is that…

00:16:44.508 --> 00:16:45.197
Is what?

00:16:55.751 --> 00:16:59.329
Jinn, I…

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.441
VAN

00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:09.105
Hello, Van?

00:17:26.608 --> 00:17:28.386
I’m glad you guys are still up.

00:17:32.362 --> 00:17:34.219
Now, whose foot did that to your face?

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:35.951
Do you see that?

00:17:38.375 --> 00:17:39.043
Turn this way.

00:17:39.631 --> 00:17:40.312
This way.

00:17:40.312 --> 00:17:40.875
It’s nothing.

00:17:40.875 --> 00:17:41.375
Van.

00:17:44.566 --> 00:17:45.712
Wow.

00:17:45.926 --> 00:17:46.885
Here we go again.

00:17:52.449 --> 00:17:54.920
Guys, just listen first.

00:17:55.597 --> 00:17:57.068
I didn’t start it this time.

00:17:57.068 --> 00:17:58.455
I didn’t even do anything.

00:17:58.847 --> 00:18:00.287
Then how did you get that cut on your face?

00:18:02.427 --> 00:18:03.643
Um…

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:05.758
Be honest.

00:18:05.936 --> 00:18:08.099
I went to a friend’s birthday party.

00:18:08.919 --> 00:18:12.345
And I was having a little too much fun. So…

00:18:13.468 --> 00:18:14.322
What fun?

00:18:14.821 --> 00:18:15.719
Spill everything.

00:18:17.217 --> 00:18:19.071
Having a little too much fun
with someone else’s partner?

00:18:21.428 --> 00:18:22.555
I knew it.

00:18:22.787 --> 00:18:24.905
Well, I didn’t know they had a partner.

00:18:25.529 --> 00:18:27.452
We were just drinking together.

00:18:27.737 --> 00:18:30.434
Next thing I knew,
a bunch of feet came at me.

00:18:30.434 --> 00:18:31.520
It’s okay, dude.

00:18:31.716 --> 00:18:32.584
You deserved it.

00:18:32.976 --> 00:18:33.645
What?

00:18:33.645 --> 00:18:35.014
What about Farm? Does he know?

00:18:35.014 --> 00:18:35.514
Hey!

00:18:36.263 --> 00:18:36.940
Please.

00:18:37.546 --> 00:18:40.272
Don’t let Farm know. Ever.

00:18:41.948 --> 00:18:46.160
I came to you guys tonight
because I didn’t want to see him.

00:18:46.374 --> 00:18:48.468
So keep it between us three.

00:18:50.126 --> 00:18:51.676
Why? Why can’t Farm know?

00:18:51.836 --> 00:18:53.567
I don’t want to hear him nag.

00:18:55.492 --> 00:18:56.270
Let me stay over.

00:18:57.429 --> 00:18:58.975
Please, Jinn. Let me stay over.

00:18:59.599 --> 00:19:00.580
Van!

00:19:01.026 --> 00:19:01.959
Please, J.

00:19:02.369 --> 00:19:04.180
Don’t talk to me. Ask Jinn.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.107
Let me spend the night.

00:19:05.588 --> 00:19:08.260
My first problem isn’t sorted yet,
and now I’ve got a second one.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.036
I texted Farm and told him
I’m not coming back tonight.

00:19:16.961 --> 00:19:18.192
Did you really have to?

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.598
You guys are roommates, not boyfriends.

00:19:21.899 --> 00:19:26.548
I don’t even have to look
to feel the judgment in your stares.

00:19:29.971 --> 00:19:32.487
Spare Farm, I’m begging you.

00:19:33.057 --> 00:19:34.937
You’ve warned me like a million times.

00:19:37.451 --> 00:19:38.848
What if… hypothetically…

00:19:39.793 --> 00:19:43.242
Hypothetically. Just hypothetically.

00:19:43.545 --> 00:19:44.150
What?

00:19:45.327 --> 00:19:50.890
What if Farm and I started dating for real?

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.106
Would you guys—

00:19:52.534 --> 00:19:57.425
I think if you could stop being a prick when
it comes to love, then we can talk about this.

00:19:57.924 --> 00:20:02.046
But I’m sure, in this lifetime and the next,
you’re not changing.

00:20:02.438 --> 00:20:05.828
So stop thinking about it. Trust me.

00:20:06.381 --> 00:20:07.413
What?

00:20:09.856 --> 00:20:10.558
Van.

00:20:12.483 --> 00:20:13.366
Seriously, answer me this.

00:20:14.436 --> 00:20:15.685
Yes?

00:20:16.327 --> 00:20:18.275
Do you ever want to
get serious with anyone at all?

00:20:24.443 --> 00:20:25.149
I do.

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:26.978
Of course, I freaking do.

00:20:29.591 --> 00:20:31.666
But I don’t know why…

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.858
after dating someone for a while,

00:20:34.464 --> 00:20:36.460
I ended up doing some bad shit to them.

00:20:37.441 --> 00:20:42.064
But I’m not happy with
this constant failure in love.

00:20:42.795 --> 00:20:44.447
Everyone wants a good kind of love, right?

00:20:45.838 --> 00:20:46.859
Well…

00:20:47.554 --> 00:20:49.870
Before you ask for good love,

00:20:50.761 --> 00:20:53.263
try being good love for someone first.

00:21:04.795 --> 00:21:05.663
Whoa.

00:21:06.305 --> 00:21:07.507
Way to go, Life Coach.

00:21:07.507 --> 00:21:08.638
I’m serious.

00:21:09.565 --> 00:21:11.157
You just broke your finger, right?

00:21:11.157 --> 00:21:13.427
Your brain didn’t get damaged or anything?

00:21:13.427 --> 00:21:14.669
Asshole.

00:21:15.364 --> 00:21:16.764
I warned you as a friend.

00:21:18.422 --> 00:21:23.782
But seriously, after that accident,
you seem a lot more mature.

00:21:24.513 --> 00:21:27.032
Both your words and actions.

00:21:27.157 --> 00:21:29.759
You seem different.

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:35.070
Don’t you feel it, Jinn?

00:21:35.658 --> 00:21:36.832
You’re with him all the time.

00:21:38.561 --> 00:21:40.042
I don’t know. Just go to sleep.

00:21:40.042 --> 00:21:41.278
It’s almost morning.

00:21:45.664 --> 00:21:47.252
Fine. I’ll freaking sleep.

00:22:00.422 --> 00:22:01.823
You didn’t come back because

00:22:02.928 --> 00:22:04.435
you were scared I’d see your wound, right?

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:06.961
Yes, sir.

00:22:08.369 --> 00:22:11.756
And you do know
a wound doesn’t heal in one day?

00:22:13.236 --> 00:22:13.927
You’re right.

00:22:14.533 --> 00:22:15.550
I didn’t think about that.

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:16.218
Van!

00:22:17.127 --> 00:22:18.120
Easy there.

00:22:19.047 --> 00:22:20.991
He got checked too
when I took J to the hospital this morning.

00:22:21.241 --> 00:22:22.257
The doctor said it’s shallow.

00:22:22.756 --> 00:22:24.783
No stitches needed.

00:22:25.799 --> 00:22:26.415
See?

00:22:28.804 --> 00:22:29.485
Hey.

00:22:29.824 --> 00:22:32.954
Good thing you got some of that
bad blood knocked out of you.

00:22:33.542 --> 00:22:34.435
Mai, you dick.

00:22:35.291 --> 00:22:36.608
You always find a chance to roast me.

00:22:36.608 --> 00:22:37.537
I’m gonna punch you.

00:22:37.537 --> 00:22:38.625
You want another cut?

00:22:44.978 --> 00:22:46.435
Hey, where are you going?

00:22:50.624 --> 00:22:52.062
When it comes to Van,

00:22:52.507 --> 00:22:54.829
my holy father always loses it.

00:22:55.827 --> 00:22:56.969
It’s weird.

00:22:57.825 --> 00:22:58.517
Is it?

00:22:59.176 --> 00:22:59.909
Hm?

00:23:04.794 --> 00:23:05.503
Mai.

00:23:06.163 --> 00:23:08.062
Looks like you’ve got something to say.

00:23:20.604 --> 00:23:21.785
My car is fixed.

00:23:21.785 --> 00:23:22.933
Really? Let me see.

00:23:26.891 --> 00:23:29.001
You two are weird.

00:23:43.534 --> 00:23:45.839
I’m fine. You don’t have to worry—

00:23:45.839 --> 00:23:46.597
Just lie down.

00:23:47.168 --> 00:23:48.663
But I’m alright.

00:23:48.663 --> 00:23:51.941
J told me it was really late
when you showed up at their place.

00:23:53.084 --> 00:23:55.214
You also got up early
to take him to the hospital.

00:23:55.214 --> 00:23:57.947
And the meds you took
need to be followed by sleep.

00:24:02.281 --> 00:24:03.441
Seriously, Van…

00:24:04.564 --> 00:24:06.068
why were you afraid to tell me?

00:24:07.545 --> 00:24:08.045
Huh?

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:09.612
What did you say?

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:14.529
What made you crash at Jinn’s
instead of coming back to our place?

00:24:19.749 --> 00:24:22.300
Come on. Don’t be so serious.

00:24:23.167 --> 00:24:25.300
We’re sharing the place as roommates.

00:24:26.502 --> 00:24:27.736
You’re not a freeloader.

00:24:28.603 --> 00:24:31.805
It bothers me that you didn’t feel
uncomfortable enough to come back.

00:24:32.731 --> 00:24:35.542
And if I’m the reason, I’m definitely not okay.

00:24:35.778 --> 00:24:37.052
It’s not like that.

00:24:37.367 --> 00:24:41.118
I was just scared you’d get mad
because I got into a fight.

00:24:41.276 --> 00:24:44.449
You should’ve been more afraid
of getting hurt than me getting angry.

00:24:48.665 --> 00:24:50.317
Yeah. Right?

00:24:51.696 --> 00:24:52.920
You’ve got a point.

00:24:53.038 --> 00:24:53.755
Van.

00:24:54.504 --> 00:24:55.004
Huh?

00:24:57.072 --> 00:25:00.499
Whatever happens from now on,
come back to our place.

00:25:02.252 --> 00:25:03.627
You don’t have to tell me everything.

00:25:04.021 --> 00:25:05.069
Just come back.

00:25:07.236 --> 00:25:08.370
Farm.

00:25:11.482 --> 00:25:12.591
Get some rest.

00:25:13.083 --> 00:25:14.316
I’m gonna go get you the lecture notes.

00:25:15.498 --> 00:25:16.192
Wait.

00:25:20.585 --> 00:25:23.713
I promise I won’t get into trouble again.

00:25:24.501 --> 00:25:25.557
I’m scared I’ll get hurt.

00:25:26.148 --> 00:25:27.679
And I don’t want you worrying.

00:25:33.628 --> 00:25:34.310
Yeah.

00:25:35.118 --> 00:25:36.216
I’ll stop nagging you.

00:25:36.827 --> 00:25:38.030
I don’t want to annoy you.

00:25:38.897 --> 00:25:40.520
And it wastes my energy.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.760
If I were a good person,

00:25:49.193 --> 00:25:50.983
I’d have hit on you a long time ago.

00:25:57.385 --> 00:25:59.097
You don’t have to try that hard.

00:26:04.799 --> 00:26:05.731
Bye-bye.

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:18.082
Gosh, he’s cute.

00:26:40.345 --> 00:26:41.041
Shit!

00:26:41.317 --> 00:26:42.171
My baby!

00:26:44.239 --> 00:26:44.959
What is it?

00:26:45.254 --> 00:26:46.408
My car is fixed.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.896
Really? Let me see.

00:26:48.842 --> 00:26:49.593
Does it look the same?

00:26:49.869 --> 00:26:51.471
Damn, like it never crashed.

00:26:51.865 --> 00:26:53.016
They fixed it up real nice.

00:26:53.016 --> 00:26:53.631
True.

00:26:53.749 --> 00:26:54.646
What a relief.

00:27:10.932 --> 00:27:11.869
What are you guys doing?

00:27:17.739 --> 00:27:19.865
I’m sleeping at my house tonight.

00:27:20.732 --> 00:27:21.669
I’m gonna go check on my car too.

00:27:22.418 --> 00:27:23.742
Will your mom let you drive?

00:27:24.904 --> 00:27:27.122
I just want to see it with my own eyes.

00:27:27.477 --> 00:27:29.986
I’ve missed my baby so badly.

00:27:31.582 --> 00:27:33.813
Fine. I’m sleeping at my house too.

00:27:33.931 --> 00:27:35.882
So tomorrow we can come to class together.

00:27:39.901 --> 00:27:40.554
What?

00:27:41.795 --> 00:27:43.071
Are you addicted to me?

00:27:44.036 --> 00:27:44.841
Addicted?

00:27:46.102 --> 00:27:48.314
Can’t be apart for one night, huh?

00:27:49.082 --> 00:27:50.179
Your heart will just tear?

00:27:51.263 --> 00:27:52.008
Moron.

00:27:52.236 --> 00:27:53.407
I just want to see my mom.

00:28:00.262 --> 00:28:02.396
You two are weird.

00:28:04.997 --> 00:28:05.881
Weird how?

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:06.595
Right.

00:28:15.781 --> 00:28:16.629
Whoa.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.824
Your friend’s garage is awesome.

00:28:21.824 --> 00:28:22.408
Right?

00:28:22.881 --> 00:28:25.198
I asked for the best mechanic.

00:28:25.198 --> 00:28:26.085
Look here.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.978
The paint is spotless.

00:28:28.411 --> 00:28:30.661
Even in sunlight,
you can’t see a single scratch.

00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:31.373
Yeah?

00:28:31.885 --> 00:28:33.082
You’re the best dad.

00:28:33.318 --> 00:28:35.743
I just want to give you a trophy.

00:28:36.354 --> 00:28:36.978
Come here.

00:28:39.558 --> 00:28:41.370
What a pity.

00:28:42.079 --> 00:28:45.001
Because it’s going to sit here
and collect dust for months.

00:28:48.232 --> 00:28:49.605
Auntie Jen.

00:28:49.605 --> 00:28:50.841
Hey, honey. You’re here?

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.646
Auntie Jen.

00:28:56.123 --> 00:28:57.501
Aw.

00:28:57.757 --> 00:28:58.680
What’s wrong now?

00:28:59.665 --> 00:29:00.613
I’m hungry.

00:29:00.613 --> 00:29:01.249
Hungry?

00:29:03.022 --> 00:29:04.160
(Bullshit.)

00:29:09.758 --> 00:29:11.514
Your mom got you this time.

00:29:11.672 --> 00:29:13.435
Surprised, right, Jinn?

00:29:13.927 --> 00:29:18.084
I didn’t know she’d run off
on a trip out of town with her friends.

00:29:18.498 --> 00:29:20.741
Normally, we tell each other
where we’re going.

00:29:21.293 --> 00:29:23.019
This time, I’m really mad.

00:29:23.511 --> 00:29:25.317
Please tell her that, Auntie Jen.

00:29:25.317 --> 00:29:25.817
Hey.

00:29:26.487 --> 00:29:28.368
But once she knew you were coming back,

00:29:28.447 --> 00:29:31.585
she called and told me to
take good care of you.

00:29:33.553 --> 00:29:35.225
Alright, I’m less mad now.

00:29:36.545 --> 00:29:37.228
Still mad, though.

00:29:37.228 --> 00:29:37.828
What?

00:29:38.064 --> 00:29:40.580
So which is it? Mad or not mad?

00:29:41.447 --> 00:29:42.284
Well…

00:29:42.284 --> 00:29:43.309
Such a child.

00:29:48.076 --> 00:29:50.411
You were born on the same day as me.

00:29:51.455 --> 00:29:52.843
Child-ish.

00:29:53.631 --> 00:29:55.512
As if you’re so mature.

00:29:58.034 --> 00:29:59.259
I’m more mature and grown-up.

00:29:59.535 --> 00:30:00.988
What, you’re from the future or something?

00:30:02.347 --> 00:30:03.752
Enough, enough.

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:05.113
Stop bickering already.

00:30:05.468 --> 00:30:06.144
Eat.

00:30:07.129 --> 00:30:08.121
Yes, Uncle Wee.

00:30:08.791 --> 00:30:11.037
Oh—Uncle Wee, Auntie Jen,

00:30:11.037 --> 00:30:14.302
do you know which friend group
my mom went on a trip with?

00:30:18.499 --> 00:30:20.932
Didn’t your mom tell you
who she was going with?

00:30:21.326 --> 00:30:23.023
I didn’t ask.

00:30:23.397 --> 00:30:27.012
Once I knew she’d sneaked off on a trip,
I didn’t feel like asking more.

00:30:27.997 --> 00:30:29.676
She should be with her…

00:30:31.331 --> 00:30:35.065
friends from the clothing industry.

00:30:35.695 --> 00:30:36.982
Ah!

00:30:40.567 --> 00:30:42.923
Are you okay being alone?

00:30:43.081 --> 00:30:44.619
Do you want to sleep over in J’s room
so you won’t feel lonely?

00:30:44.836 --> 00:30:46.020
Ah…

00:30:46.236 --> 00:30:48.178
I’m totally fine on my own.

00:30:48.355 --> 00:30:51.799
But I might bother you for food sometimes.

00:30:51.917 --> 00:30:52.417
Sure.

00:30:52.693 --> 00:30:55.905
Sleeping alone must be lonely.

00:30:57.993 --> 00:31:01.054
Being apart from you is a bonus in my life.

00:31:23.983 --> 00:31:29.799
YOU PUNCHED ME AND THEN
SENT HEALING SUPPLIES?
JUST GO TO HELL, BASTARD.

00:31:35.611 --> 00:31:36.111
Hey.

00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:37.271
Just go to hell, you asshole!

00:31:37.271 --> 00:31:38.250
When will you stop screwing with me?

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:40.421
You whine and chase me away
every time you lose a fight.

00:31:40.421 --> 00:31:41.116
Damn you.

00:31:41.333 --> 00:31:42.976
Enough! Gosh, you’re strong.

00:31:43.429 --> 00:31:45.878
I’m begging, guys. Will you stop fighting?

00:31:46.134 --> 00:31:47.530
Go meet the god of death in hell.

00:31:51.347 --> 00:31:52.340
Shit! Mai!

00:31:52.458 --> 00:31:53.474
Did you just hit me?

00:31:58.056 --> 00:31:59.489
Sting, doesn’t it?

00:32:04.916 --> 00:32:07.313
ORDER FOR: MR. JEROME

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:28.089
Watch this turn.

00:32:28.089 --> 00:32:28.589
Hey.

00:32:28.589 --> 00:32:29.089
See?

00:32:29.719 --> 00:32:30.529
Pretty awesome, huh?

00:32:30.529 --> 00:32:31.289
Then he cuts into the inner lane.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.589
That’s our boy.

00:32:34.589 --> 00:32:37.451
Right. He’s great.

00:32:45.941 --> 00:32:48.635
Be clingy all you want,
you’re not getting the car keys.

00:32:48.635 --> 00:32:50.475
Come on, Mom.

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:52.541
I just missed you.

00:32:52.915 --> 00:32:55.753
Awww.

00:32:56.699 --> 00:32:59.448
So, how is it going living with Jinn?

00:32:59.842 --> 00:33:01.691
Do you help him with
the house chores at all?

00:33:02.814 --> 00:33:05.442
Why would I? I just let him
take care of everything for me.

00:33:05.856 --> 00:33:08.562
Ow, Mom! Why did you hit me?

00:33:09.705 --> 00:33:11.742
I can see you two are closer now.

00:33:12.116 --> 00:33:14.705
You used to throw punches
the second you saw each other.

00:33:14.882 --> 00:33:19.015
But now you can eat at the same table.

00:33:19.192 --> 00:33:21.255
You even scoop food for each other.

00:33:21.491 --> 00:33:23.508
It’s like feeding a dog.

00:33:23.744 --> 00:33:25.316
- Feeding a dog?
- Mom!

00:33:25.434 --> 00:33:27.310
How could you call that little baby a dog?

00:33:28.137 --> 00:33:29.447
He’s no little baby.

00:33:29.447 --> 00:33:30.748
We were born on the same day.

00:33:30.748 --> 00:33:33.983
You said you were
more grown-up than him at dinner.

00:33:33.983 --> 00:33:36.722
Now suddenly, you remember
you share a birthday?

00:33:37.057 --> 00:33:37.713
Hm?

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:40.607
Tell me.

00:33:42.203 --> 00:33:45.097
When did you two start hating each other?

00:33:45.944 --> 00:33:49.578
As far as I remember,
you two were always competing.

00:33:49.795 --> 00:33:51.424
And always ended up getting hurt.

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:55.513
And always got whipped by you.

00:33:56.478 --> 00:33:57.667
Ouch, Mom!

00:33:58.078 --> 00:33:58.704
Come here.

00:33:58.901 --> 00:33:59.629
Auntie Jen!

00:34:01.126 --> 00:34:01.626
Auntie!

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:03.720
This time, J started it.

00:34:03.897 --> 00:34:05.007
Do not talk back.

00:34:05.007 --> 00:34:06.298
You both take responsibility.

00:34:06.475 --> 00:34:06.975
Should I go on?

00:34:06.975 --> 00:34:07.565
Oh, yeah.

00:34:07.565 --> 00:34:08.605
No. Please, no. Enough.

00:34:08.605 --> 00:34:11.525
- Come here.
- No more. Mom, help.

00:34:11.525 --> 00:34:12.223
No!

00:34:14.354 --> 00:34:14.854
Ouch.

00:34:15.543 --> 00:34:16.604
Just hit J.

00:34:16.742 --> 00:34:17.645
Don’t dodge it.

00:34:18.197 --> 00:34:19.999
(Why did we have to get punished together?)

00:34:20.452 --> 00:34:21.883
(Auntie Jen’s hits are the real deal.)

00:34:22.316 --> 00:34:23.499
(Like mother, like son.)

00:34:38.018 --> 00:34:38.873
(I finally get it.)

00:34:39.622 --> 00:34:43.877
(For you, it can be anyone
in the whole world but me.)

00:35:04.588 --> 00:35:05.635
What the hell are you doing?

00:35:07.487 --> 00:35:08.582
Have you gone to bed?

00:35:10.236 --> 00:35:10.999
What?

00:35:14.505 --> 00:35:17.002
Gone to bed?

00:35:18.893 --> 00:35:20.969
I wouldn’t be standing here if I had.

00:35:21.875 --> 00:35:24.832
What a dumb question.

00:35:26.743 --> 00:35:27.959
Are you sleepy?

00:35:29.929 --> 00:35:30.888
Why?

00:35:32.444 --> 00:35:35.172
Up for a bike race?

00:35:36.433 --> 00:35:37.181
Huh?

00:35:38.422 --> 00:35:39.348
Bike race.

00:35:48.575 --> 00:35:50.025
I’ve never thought that.

00:35:51.758 --> 00:35:52.831
I’ve never hated you.

00:36:14.873 --> 00:36:16.039
What are you doing?

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:19.103
You didn’t remind me the professor is
grading our draping assignment tomorrow.

00:36:19.664 --> 00:36:22.959
I slept in the infirmary all day
and totally forgot.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.439
But I saw you finished it yesterday.

00:36:25.519 --> 00:36:28.404
Finished, my ass. It’s still far from done.

00:36:28.484 --> 00:36:30.849
So you’re going to class
at 10:30 pm to work on it?

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:32.904
Do I have a choice?

00:36:34.467 --> 00:36:36.564
The building’s closed.
How are you even getting in?

00:36:58.388 --> 00:36:59.174
Farm!

00:36:59.895 --> 00:37:00.940
You can’t turn it on.

00:37:01.581 --> 00:37:03.851
The guard will see we’re in here.

00:37:04.272 --> 00:37:06.303
How are you supposed to work in the dark?

00:37:06.503 --> 00:37:08.239
You’re going to stab yourself with those pins.

00:37:08.239 --> 00:37:09.962
My eyes will adjust.

00:37:10.122 --> 00:37:11.374
You, come here.

00:37:40.641 --> 00:37:41.971
Aren’t you working on yours?

00:37:42.384 --> 00:37:43.181
Mine’s done.

00:37:43.542 --> 00:37:44.147
What?

00:37:44.949 --> 00:37:46.239
Then why did you come with me?

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:48.321
How could I let you come here alone?

00:37:48.561 --> 00:37:50.497
Hurry up, so we can go home.

00:37:54.224 --> 00:37:55.353
Yes, sir.

00:37:55.614 --> 00:37:57.188
I’m hurrying.

00:38:21.472 --> 00:38:22.462
You suck.

00:38:23.204 --> 00:38:24.310
Can’t you go faster?

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:26.500
I’ve got one hand here.
Why don’t you overtake me?

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.545
Fine. Since you asked for it.

00:38:36.691 --> 00:38:38.280
That’s all you got?

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.605
Crap! Damn it.

00:39:22.403 --> 00:39:24.675
My hand hurts, and I’m still in the lead.

00:39:25.657 --> 00:39:27.378
Hey! J! J!

00:39:32.669 --> 00:39:33.365
Are you hurt?

00:39:33.666 --> 00:39:34.547
Are you injured, J?

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:37.182
No.

00:39:39.627 --> 00:39:40.484
You scared me.

00:39:59.097 --> 00:40:00.781
What’s wrong with you, though?

00:40:01.021 --> 00:40:01.871
Why don’t you go to bed?

00:40:02.192 --> 00:40:03.401
Are you addicted to competing or what?

00:40:04.864 --> 00:40:07.128
You ditched the ‘bonus in your life’
to compete with me.

00:40:12.579 --> 00:40:13.265
Hey.

00:40:13.686 --> 00:40:14.186
What?

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:17.933
I’ve never thought that.

00:40:20.558 --> 00:40:21.265
What?

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:24.810
I’ve never hated you.

00:40:39.642 --> 00:40:40.182
I think…

00:40:42.224 --> 00:40:43.622
I’m throwing the white flag this time.

00:40:50.507 --> 00:40:51.584
I’m going home.

00:40:52.205 --> 00:40:52.970
Don’t go yet.

00:40:56.878 --> 00:40:57.998
Stay and talk to me first.

00:41:06.862 --> 00:41:07.579
Hey.

00:41:08.661 --> 00:41:09.970
Should we grab something to eat after this?

00:41:10.351 --> 00:41:11.417
How about Auntie Yim’s diner?

00:41:11.898 --> 00:41:12.853
It’s close by.

00:41:16.781 --> 00:41:19.011
Farm, hold it higher. I can’t see.

00:41:20.554 --> 00:41:21.411
Farm!

00:41:29.305 --> 00:41:32.391
Since when did you
start letting me talk to myself?

00:42:04.873 --> 00:42:06.680
What is ‘good love’ anyway?

00:42:08.604 --> 00:42:10.134
Can I even be that for you?

00:42:10.925 --> 00:42:11.629
Hm?

00:42:31.805 --> 00:42:32.597
Are you done?

00:42:33.639 --> 00:42:36.676
Ah… only a bit left.

00:42:37.558 --> 00:42:38.950
I can finish the rest tomorrow.

00:42:40.473 --> 00:42:42.452
My brain’s fried. I can’t think anymore.

00:42:45.478 --> 00:42:46.178
Should we go then?

00:42:46.178 --> 00:42:46.678
Sure.

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.133
Let’s go.

00:42:48.974 --> 00:42:49.820
Let me grab my stuff.

00:42:50.682 --> 00:42:51.372
Let’s go.

00:42:57.664 --> 00:42:58.587
Oh, shit!

00:43:31.236 --> 00:43:32.303
- Van…
- Shh!

00:43:47.187 --> 00:43:48.066
He should be gone already.

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:59.542
We came in through that door, not this one.

00:44:00.103 --> 00:44:01.727
We almost got caught, dude.

00:44:02.028 --> 00:44:03.183
I didn’t know.

00:44:03.744 --> 00:44:05.226
I always use this door.

00:44:07.711 --> 00:44:08.465
Come on.

00:44:09.467 --> 00:44:10.177
Come.

00:44:14.706 --> 00:44:19.904
This evening, my dad asked
when we even started hating each other.

00:44:23.672 --> 00:44:25.108
And I honestly couldn’t think of a reason

00:44:28.294 --> 00:44:30.000
why we hate each other.

00:44:36.224 --> 00:44:37.897
What do you gain from bringing this up?

00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:46.418
Then I thought it through.

00:44:47.761 --> 00:44:54.222
I realized the reason I couldn’t
give him the answer was because…

00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:59.768
I’ve never hated you.

00:45:03.275 --> 00:45:03.947
Asshole.

00:45:04.749 --> 00:45:05.507
What now?

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:11.800
Now that you know I still ike you,
you want to level up your pranks on me?

00:45:14.345 --> 00:45:19.641
Act all nice, say sweet things, soften me up,
and then laugh in my face in the end?

00:45:20.988 --> 00:45:22.728
Jinn, calm down.

00:45:22.728 --> 00:45:23.959
I’m not falling for that.

00:45:31.674 --> 00:45:32.333
J.

00:45:34.537 --> 00:45:35.970
You wrote in your notebook:

00:45:37.072 --> 00:45:42.601
“I finally get it. For you, it can be
anyone in the whole world but me.”

00:45:44.224 --> 00:45:45.691
That’s not what I think.

00:45:47.875 --> 00:45:52.127
You promised me you’d forget
everything in that notebook.

00:45:52.347 --> 00:45:53.049
No.

00:45:53.851 --> 00:45:54.827
I’m not forgetting it.

00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:57.129
I remember everything.

00:45:58.231 --> 00:45:59.648
Every word.

00:46:02.634 --> 00:46:03.689
You’re an asshole.

00:46:09.521 --> 00:46:10.479
I won’t forget it.

00:46:14.342 --> 00:46:15.962
Because it helped me
figure out my own feelings too.

00:47:15.696 --> 00:47:16.792
You don’t have to force anything.

00:47:17.053 --> 00:47:18.355
Just be yourself.

00:47:18.355 --> 00:47:20.518
I just want to be a better person.

00:47:20.618 --> 00:47:22.015
Can’t I?

00:47:22.897 --> 00:47:24.739
Now that I’m with him twenty-four seven,

00:47:24.739 --> 00:47:26.049
I feel like…

00:47:26.049 --> 00:47:26.699
Jinn!

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:28.882
It’s weird that he’s actually a good person.

00:47:30.445 --> 00:47:32.078
Don’t tell me you’ve already fallen for him.

00:47:34.543 --> 00:47:35.710
You’ve recovered. Go home.

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:36.860
I said I haven’t recovered yet.

00:47:37.361 --> 00:47:38.598
Bad personality.

00:47:38.778 --> 00:47:40.210
Mediocre looks.

00:47:40.611 --> 00:47:41.922
What’s there to like?
