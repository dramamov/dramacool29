00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.420
Listen,

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.860
if you dare glare at a client again,

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.910
I won't hold back.

00:02:06.951 --> 00:02:08.620
What does he mean Ou Yang
is better than me?

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.990
Is that even design?

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.360
A rich kid with no skills,

00:02:11.373 --> 00:02:13.620
suddenly deciding to become
a designer in his thirties,

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:15.830
just to gain some recognition

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.860
and fool young girls.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.860
It's a disgrace to the profession.

00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:20.528
That's why I recommended you.

00:02:20.617 --> 00:02:22.230
You increased the cost by 50,000 yuan.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.262
Are you out of your mind?

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.420
50,000 yuan can buy
a much higher quality of life.

00:02:25.484 --> 00:02:26.860
If we calculate it over ten years,

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.860
that's only 13.5 yuan per day.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.550
Over twenty years, it's just 6.75 yuan.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.550
Quite reasonable, right?

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.190
Mr. Yu,

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.990
it's definitely worth it.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.420
But 50,000 yuan is still a lot of money.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.110
That's basically Wu's salary
for six months.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.300
And whenever we go out now,
I'm the one paying.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.180
Yeah, I feel like I'm being...

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.180
So you mean being kept?

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.230
You know that too.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.300
Hey.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.180
You still haven't given Wu a raise.

00:02:50.217 --> 00:02:50.989
This is Shanghai.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.390
With such a small salary,
when will he think about marriage?

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.580
We're talking about Ou Yang now.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.300
What does his marriage
have to do with this?

00:02:56.306 --> 00:02:57.620
Fine, let's go back to Ou Yang.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.230
Since the client chose him,

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.140
if you're unhappy,

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.460
prove you're better
with a superior design,

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.860
instead of sulking here.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.440
Complaining doesn't solve problems!

00:03:06.795 --> 00:03:08.460
- Where are you going?
- The restroom.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.550
Then why take your bag?

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.460
Mind your own business.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.350
A lazy donkey produces more waste.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:23.550
Master Designer Yu,

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.420
you came here
just for this piece of wood?

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.830
I know.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.180
You always provide artists
with the best materials.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.140
Yu Yu, you should
explain this to the client.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.390
Because this type of wood
is only available here.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.740
But it's already been reserved
by someone else.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:46.670
Can you give it to me?

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.990
No, I can't.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.270
A museum is opening.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.860
I need it
for an eight-meter-tall mascot.

00:03:53.706 --> 00:03:55.350
Does the contract specify the material?

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.790
No, it doesn't.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.270
Will the mascot stay
in the museum afterward?

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.510
No.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.270
So no one will lie on it and cry?

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.620
Or sleep on it?

00:04:09.306 --> 00:04:10.790
Even though it's eight meters tall,

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.790
it's not that high yet.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.830
Will it be discarded afterward?

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.020
Yes.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.470
I want to turn it into a dining table,

00:04:25.706 --> 00:04:27.590
to hold a person's sweet
and bitter moments.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.150
I also want to make it into a bed,

00:04:30.306 --> 00:04:31.990
to carry someone's joys and sorrows.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.180
Hey.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.290
Gu Yejia gave me your test results.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.160
Hmph.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.380
Tell her I don't like her tattling.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.380
Well...

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.590
She's only trying to help you.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.150
Come over tonight.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.760
I'll make you some healthy food.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.670
Hmph.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.060
Can I eat at your place every day?

00:05:02.306 --> 00:05:03.620
That's definitely not allowed.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.710
You'd ruin the family harmony.

00:05:05.751 --> 00:05:07.150
Then what's the point if I go once?

00:05:08.617 --> 00:05:09.940
It won't make a difference.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.990
So...

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.550
I'm going for barbecue.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.230
Barbecue?

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.220
Just imagine,

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.740
lean beef mixed
with just the right amount of fat,

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.940
sizzling over high charcoal heat.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.670
Take a bite at medium-rare,

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.180
and the fat and cholesterol,

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.550
enhanced by the Maillard reaction,

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.620
burst with savory aroma in your mouth.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.500
Then explosion.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.070
How wonderful.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.990
Bro, I want to go too.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.990
Goodbye.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.020
Director Zhong.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.910
Hey, Dr. Gu.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.230
Here's a document for you to sign.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.070
Sure.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.310
Oh, right.

00:05:54.328 --> 00:05:55.470
I finished talking to Yu Yu.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.030
I gave him a severe scolding.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:58.390
How did he respond?

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.710
He said he hates you tattling on him.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.710
Why is he so...

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:06.780
Annoying,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.910
immature, weird,

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.230
proud, scheming,

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.700
stubborn, complicated, and difficult.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.230
Complaining or not,

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.620
you should still try to advise him
as a family member.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.860
Alright, don't worry.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.500
Tonight, I'll have him over for dinner.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.470
What are you doing? Washing the car?

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.150
I'm doomed.
It's almost the end of the month,

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:49.740
and I haven't sold a single car.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.440
The manager is going to scold me.

00:06:51.884 --> 00:06:53.380
If you want to hit your sales target,

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.820
you can't just wait in the store
for customers to come in.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.300
You need to
open your eyes to opportunities.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.670
You need to look outside.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.340
Outside?

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.820
You need to find some potential clients.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.460
For example,

00:07:08.328 --> 00:07:11.060
that handsome guy who delivered
something to your house last time,

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.910
seemed pretty good.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:14.380
You mean Shen Wu?

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:15.990
Oh, he is Wu.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.060
We haven't been in touch since then.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.550
So what if you haven't?
Just message him.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:21.670
Invite him for coffee

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.030
and have a chat.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:24.260
Then casually ask

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.030
if he's thinking about changing cars.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.910
Then just show him this brochure.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:29.500
Not a good idea.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:30.670
What's wrong with that?

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.995
Even if the deal doesn't go through,
you still gain goodwill, right?

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.820
Let's go eat barbecue.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.500
No money.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:52.780
Just withdrew.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.030
Brand new.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.260
Still smells of ink.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.940
What are you doing,
showing off your wealth?

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.180
Is that necessary, Mr. Yu?

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:02.350
I'm not showing off.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.110
I just want to show you

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:06.300
why you're short on cash while I'm not.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:08.550
Why?

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:09.620
Because I use cash.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.940
Cash represents a kind of sentiment

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.470
and the quality of life.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.500
At the same time, it's also a warning.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:17.430
Look.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.910
As this cash decreases,

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.030
your sense of urgency grows.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.860
Then you stay alert.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:27.500
You're outdated.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.500
Most people

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.710
aren't rich enough
to treat money just as numbers.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:35.190
People like you

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.350
use electronic payments,

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.380
which quietly make money disappear,

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.860
fall into overdraft,

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.110
and ruin themselves.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.310
Got it?

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:43.590
Wu, ignore his rambling.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:44.710
Just take the money.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:45.730
Free money, don't miss it.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:46.780
He closed the bag already,

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.195
and didn't even let me touch it.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:53.500
Oh, right.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.230
I went for a check-up this morning.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.260
Everything is perfectly healthy.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:08:59.830
So,

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:01.884
(BBQ. Couple Set Discount)
let's go for barbecue.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.110
Oh, I'm not going.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:06.740
I have to go back to work.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:08.380
- Ah?
- You're working overtime?

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:09.900
Then what about dinner?

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.470
You can mooch off Mr. Yu's barbecue.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.350
I'm not going. I don't want barbecue.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.460
Hey!

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:16.470
Nobody's going?

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.710
Why don't you just go with Ms. Lin?

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:19.660
Oh, right.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.260
That couple set has a discount.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.230
Just tell them Ms. Lin is your wife.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:30.110
No one will notice.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.470
Why would I pretend to be his wife?

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:33.830
I don't mind.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.350
Some sacrifices
are worth it for barbecue.

00:09:40.773 --> 00:09:42.380
Is it really a sacrifice to go with me?

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.340
That's not important.

00:09:44.662 --> 00:09:45.830
Let's go together. Come on.

00:09:45.862 --> 00:09:47.589
I want the deluxe barbecue set.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.070
With beef tenderloin and lamb chops,

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.470
perilla leaf wrapped garlic,

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:51.310
one bite,

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:52.900
delicious!

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.710
With red wine
and double scoop ice cream.

00:09:54.728 --> 00:09:55.840
- You go yourself.
- Alright.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.190
If you don't go, how do I get 20% off?

00:09:57.195 --> 00:09:58.110
I'm not your coupon.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.340
Xiaoxiao, let's go.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.740
Oh, okay.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.340
Bye.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:13.500
Wu, how about...

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.780
No, Mr. Yu. I already made plans.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.030
Bye.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:19.150
Delicious.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.470
What's up?
Why did you want to meet today?

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:35.430
Here is the thing.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.310
I have something I'd like to ask you.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:42.380
After all,
your designer circle is high-end,

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:43.710
skill level is high,

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:44.660
and income is high too.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.470
Not high. Everything can be high.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.070
Income isn't high at all.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.860
So what do you usually use
for getting around?

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.230
Transportation?

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:58.660
First, by foot.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:10:59.860
Then hitch a ride.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.950
If that doesn't work, use a shared bike.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:02.990
I don't take taxis anyway.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:11.070
Pretty eco-friendly and low carbon.

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:13.190
Good exercise too.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.230
Doesn't your boyfriend work out?

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:17.270
I...

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.740
I'm single.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.260
Aren't you living with your boyfriend?

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.950
Who told you that?

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:27.230
Mr. Yu told me.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:28.380
Yu Yu?

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.350
Which eye did he
see me living with someone?

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.590
Impossible.

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:34.590
Mr. Yu never spreads rumors.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.230
He just told me
your boyfriend's name is...

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.950
What is it...

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:43.230
Dao...

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.380
Dao? My boyfriend?

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.190
His English name is Dao.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.260
Oh, so it's that Dao.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:56.660
Sorry about that.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.900
Blame Mr. Yu for this.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:02.540
It's just about lunch time.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.070
How about I treat you?

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.860
I never got to
thank you properly before.

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:08.350
I know a really good restaurant.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:09.690
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.470
Three greatest joys in life

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:18.990
are eating, eating, and eating.

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:20.620
And sleeping.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.620
That's four joys, then.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.260
Hello, check please.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:24.900
Let's split it.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:26.620
I said I'd treat you.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:27.740
Split it.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.830
I really enjoyed our chat today.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.230
Total is 528.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:33.260
528, right?

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.350
Wait a moment.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.020
Hello, I have a free salad coupon,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.140
a 20-off-400 cash voucher,

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.740
a 3% discount coupon,

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:44.950
(App Voucher)
and a 7% discount from the app.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.500
Don't mess up the order,

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.620
or the discounts won't stack.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:48.520
Okay, thanks.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.540
Thank you. Xiaoman.

00:12:49.906 --> 00:12:51.906
Can I borrow your phone
to scan the code?

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:58.660
Thanks. Done.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.260
Here's a new user

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.780
50 yuan voucher.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:06.780
How much did you end up spending?

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:08.100
64.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.020
64? How?

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.140
Used the vouchers.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:14.430
I'm telling you,

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.740
he's a real organizer type.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:17.710
In the end,

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:21.900
he managed a big group order
for four tables, twelve people.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.710
Dude, should we join the group order?

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:25.900
We could save 100 yuan.

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.380
- 100 yuan?
- 100 yuan.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:28.220
Okay.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.500
Hello, we'll join the group order.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.140
Alright.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.230
The waiters and customers
all gathered around.

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:38.350
The manager didn't feel it was a loss,

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:39.740
and even gave a bag of chips,

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:42.660
thanking us for spotting a bug.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.740
You gotta admit, he's pretty sharp.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.620
But in the end, we split it.

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:49.190
32 per person.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.070
Ouch.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.020
So I didn't mention buying a car.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:56.380
I wasn't really expecting him
to buy one anyway.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.260
But even if he didn't,

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.860
I think he's pretty impressive.

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:08.150
Marriage.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.340
Hmph.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.860
What's so great about marriage?

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.660
Every time I come home,
I see you busy in the kitchen.

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:15.190
Look at me.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:16.740
So free.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.070
Going wherever I want.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:19.380
Doing whatever I want.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:21.830
A day has twenty-four hours.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.540
Minus eight hours of sleep,

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:24.660
you still have sixteen.

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:26.780
But you spend five
of those in the kitchen.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.950
That means a third

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.430
of your waking life

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.990
is trapped in this cursed kitchen.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.070
Pathetic.

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.140
Oh, you not helping is one thing,

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:36.440
but pointing fingers at the side

00:14:36.462 --> 00:14:37.230
is annoying.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:38.830
We're from the same mother.

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:40.070
How can you be so annoying?

00:14:40.284 --> 00:14:41.860
Are we really from the same mother?

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.540
I think your nose is kind of weird.

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.190
I think you are weirder.

00:14:45.462 --> 00:14:46.995
Take that dish out quickly.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.740
I thought you'd come in a few days.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.710
Never expected you tonight.

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.470
Weren't you going for barbecue?

00:15:02.684 --> 00:15:04.260
Because of a group of unreliable people.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.460
Hey.

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:07.070
Eat the veggies yourself.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:08.620
Give the meat to the kids.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:13.110
Remember, only your wife
will always be by your side.

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:14.395
Too bad you don't have one yet.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.470
Does my mom visit often?

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.190
Yes, she lives here.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.260
Listen to me.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.420
When the mother-in-law comes over,

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.900
the son-in-law might not be too happy.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:28.830
How could that be?

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:30.350
I actually welcome her.

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:31.190
Right, Mom?

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:32.580
Did you hear that?

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.620
Yeah, it would be weirder
if my uncle showed up at home.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.140
Is that trait inherited
across generations?

00:15:44.817 --> 00:15:46.950
Hey, why is all the meat
just sitting there today?

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:49.350
Doctor's orders.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.740
She told me to make you
more vegetarian meals.

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:54.790
Doctor's orders?

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.900
Yours.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:56.740
What?

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.830
So fancy.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:00.830
Eight types of vegetables,
low cholesterol,

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:01.900
and low carb.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.260
Packed with vitamins A through G.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.230
This is just veggies
with a sprinkle of salt.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:09.740
No, there's no salt.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:10.580
You're overthinking.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.140
Just oil and vinegar.

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.110
I don't like it.

I like it, and that's enough.

Eat, it's good for you.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.780
If you want someone else's wife
to cook to your taste,

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:25.020
back in ancient times, people like you
would get us all in trouble.

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:26.950
What do you mean?

00:16:27.017 --> 00:16:28.860
A seventeen-year-old girl
who refuses to marry,

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.020
officials arrange a husband.

00:16:30.151 --> 00:16:31.860
A twenty-year-old man
who refuses to marry,

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:33.110
his family is punished.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:34.740
Understand?

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:37.070
A twenty-year-old man not married,

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:38.240
the whole family suffers.

00:16:38.951 --> 00:16:40.190
Whose terrible idea was that?

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:41.380
King Goujian of Yue.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.990
I'm telling you,

00:16:43.062 --> 00:16:44.950
don't think I'm nagging you
about marriage

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:46.660
because I'm old-fashioned.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:49.780
It's scientific advice
and gentle reminders.

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.740
Fine, then give me orders.

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:52.790
Orders are orders.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:54.350
Starting tomorrow.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:55.500
Starting today.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:57.380
No meat for him.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:58.740
Okay.

00:16:59.417 --> 00:17:01.710
I don't have the three highs,
but he's already at risk.

00:17:02.706 --> 00:17:04.470
High blood pressure,
sugar, and cholesterol.

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.670
Why does everyone act like Gu Yejia?

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:08.780
Gu Yejia?

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.180
Who?

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:11.420
A woman?

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:13.710
Our hospital's doctor
has treated him before.

00:17:13.928 --> 00:17:16.328
She's the one who told my brother
to eat more vegetables.

00:17:16.395 --> 00:17:17.630
She's good.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.150
Married?

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:22.430
No way, Mom.
She examined my brother's butt.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:23.630
So awkward.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.470
It's fine. We're family.

00:17:27.528 --> 00:17:29.328
What's the big deal
if she's examined him?

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:30.630
Once examined,

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.260
she's not an outsider anymore.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:33.817
Yes.

00:17:33.817 --> 00:17:34.990
Now she knows him thoroughly,

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:36.573
maybe things could even develop faster.

00:17:36.573 --> 00:17:37.350
Exactly, right.

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:40.020
Yeah, having a doctor
at home is so convenient.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.630
Is she forty already?

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.290
Can you eat properly?

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:45.470
The veggies are cold now.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.230
Vegetables are naturally cold.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:48.070
Even colder now.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.300
This meat is delicious.

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:51.390
There's still meat, want some?

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:52.870
You guys are going too far.

00:17:55.951 --> 00:17:58.684
(Ultra-high pressure pasteurization)
Celery, chives, garlic, and cilantro.

00:17:58.773 --> 00:18:00.430
Who would drink
this five-vegetable juice?

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.060
It tastes pretty good.

00:18:02.262 --> 00:18:04.020
And it's not exactly
a five-vegetable mix.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:06.990
Because there's no green onion.

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.990
Ninety in total.

00:18:25.706 --> 00:18:26.780
Cholesterol is too high.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.840
Blood pressure and sugar
are at dangerous levels.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.060
In your case,

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.060
if you eat more vegetables and fiber...

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.100
From today, no meat for him.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.060
(Pathology Dept)
That's the doctor's order.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.780
Nothing more to say. Take care.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:38.990
Does this count as going out?

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:44.820
Say it directly.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.470
Your store says no returns
after items leave the shop.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.990
Change all my milk to skim milk.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.540
Also, give me a box of what you drink.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.340
What can we do? We're all just workers.

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.260
Honestly, Wu is kind of pitiful.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.100
His boss is also stingy.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.060
Look, he hasn't had a raise for ages.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.060
Really?

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.870
Then your neighbor
is way too stingy.

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:16.230
Check out what gift he gave last time.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:17.950
Oh, two movie tickets.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.230
And a lollipop.

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:20.910
He must be the type

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.580
who licks the yogurt lid
for ten minutes.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:27.300
Hey, Xiaoman.

Yes.

Do you really want to talk to me?

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:28.580
Hey.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:32.060

Qing, do you think he heard just now?

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.060
Don't worry. He definitely didn't.

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.020
Can you be a little quieter?

00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:59.190
Are you taking revenge on me?

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:01.390
You're so petty.

Oh, Mr. Yu is here.

00:22:41.506 --> 00:22:43.751
Here to get your signature
on the new materials list.

00:22:43.773 --> 00:22:44.740
And take a little walk.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.670
New materials list?

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:48.300
Found the right wood?

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.300
Impressive.

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:51.430
Such a small task won't stop me.

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.300
Nice racket. Who gave it to you?

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.380
Don't touch it.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.340
It's a Federer-signed edition.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.540
Very valuable.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:04.670
The tennis coach gave it to you, right?

Already abandoning golf so quickly?

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.780
This one is for the tennis coach.

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.710
And I'll do both golf and tennis.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.540
One for work,

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:15.780
and one for personal hobby.

You can't return my serves anyway.

Who says I can't?

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:30.060
I'm warning you,

No.

Yeah. You're right about everything.

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:14.740
Computer drafting is efficient,

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:15.990
but it lacks soul.

I just eat the same meal for less money.

That's a life skill.

extraordinary satisfaction.

about me not giving you a raise.

Of course.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.100
We didn't manage last time.

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.470
And Mr. Yu loves it too.

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:23.020
I actually don't mind.

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:24.780
Oh, you two go ahead.

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:26.260
I have a date tonight.

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.540
One less tennis game won't hurt.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.390
Who said I was playing tennis?

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:30.260
Date, you know?

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.230
Concert, you know?

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:33.100
Front row, you know?

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:34.100
Whose concert?

00:26:34.106 --> 00:26:36.306
A metal band. They're
all coming. Aren't you going?

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.180
Wu.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:42.870
Accompany Mr. Yu to barbecue.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:43.910
I'll reimburse you.

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:44.990
Alright.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.300
Forget it.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.910
I don't really like barbecue
that much anyway.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:51.500
And when Mr. Yu eats,

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:52.500
he doesn't say a word.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.430
Eating in that atmosphere

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:55.580
gives me indigestion.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:04.300
By the way, can the concert be canceled?

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:05.420
What?

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:26.860
(Couple dining)

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.480
(Vegetable and mushroom dishes)

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.340
Hey.

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.870
Why do you only have
a vegetable platter? No meat platter?

00:27:32.417 --> 00:27:33.500
Sorry, we don't have one.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.528
If you think you can't finish,
you can order less.

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:36.620
Oh, no need.

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.662
I want premium lamb,
premium beef, premium pork belly,

00:27:39.662 --> 00:27:42.950
signature beef tongue, soybean paste
soup, double-skin milk and a draft beer.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.870
Do you still need the vegetable platter?

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:46.270
No.

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.150
Thanks for inviting me
to the movies, Dr. Gu.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:53.430
But this movie is so boring.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.300
Really, it's just boring.

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:57.230
Good thing we watched it together.

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:58.670
Otherwise, no one to complain with.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:00.630
Let's go eat.

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:01.470
Sure.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.340

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.910
Do you know
there's a loneliness ranking?

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:55.340
It's for when someone
goes to watch a movie alone.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:56.340
Ranked fourth.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.300
What's number one then?

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:01.230
Eating alone outside.

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.190
Isn't that your neighbor?

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:05.740
Hey, this is...

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.500
This is a couple's restaurant.

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:08.710
Is he eating alone?

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.500
Ordered all meat dishes.

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:12.990
His life's purpose must be eating meat.

00:29:13.062 --> 00:29:14.470
Not listening to any medical advice.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:15.860
Well...

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:19.340
Eating alone is truly the saddest.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.340
Let's go.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.773
But I really
do have to thank this fellow

00:29:23.795 --> 00:29:25.090
for the fact that we met.

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:26.010
Indeed.

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:27.260
But he's kind of strange.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.340
Is that so?

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:47.670
You...

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:48.780
What are you doing?

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.020
Ate too much meat yesterday.

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.260
What are you doing?

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:00.500
Checking the project quality...

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:01.710
Ouch!

00:30:03.062 --> 00:30:04.780
I just finished nailing this door frame.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:07.020
Sun, all you think about is door frames.

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:08.510
You...

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:10.230
Definitely missed some nails.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.500
(Emergency)

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:26.740
Hey, Mr. Yu.

00:30:26.884 --> 00:30:27.870
What are you doing here?

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:29.660
What happened?

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:36.580
Work injury.

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.100
You really have a thing for hospitals.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:40.670
That started after meeting you.

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:42.060
If you followed my advice,

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.217
you wouldn't have come
to the hospital so many times.

00:30:44.884 --> 00:30:46.540
I stood in line to get this for you,

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:47.500
and my legs went numb.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.780
Come, eat while it's hot.

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.830
I...

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:54.190
Um...

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:55.100
Hello, you are...

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.300
I am...

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.540
She's the doctor treating me.

00:30:57.573 --> 00:30:58.795
Oh, hello, nice to meet you.

00:30:58.990 --> 00:30:59.950
I'm Yu Yu's manager,

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:00.820
Lin Sa.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:01.950
Hello, I'm Gu Yejia.

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.100
Thank you for your care.

00:31:03.617 --> 00:31:05.260
He actually doesn't have major issues.

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.300
Just the three highs.

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.728
He just needs to be careful at home.

00:31:07.773 --> 00:31:08.550
I mean,

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:11.390
this person

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:13.150
is quite troublesome.

00:31:14.128 --> 00:31:15.230
Already has three highs.

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:16.340
You should eat less meat.

00:31:16.373 --> 00:31:17.780
The fourth high doesn't concern you.

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:19.580
Then let a girlfriend deal with it.

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:20.710
I just won't. What of it?

00:31:21.417 --> 00:31:23.150
I have some things to do. I'll go first.

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:24.060
You two keep talking.

00:31:24.951 --> 00:31:26.500
We'll meet again if there's a chance.

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:27.900
Sure.

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:33.670
The female doctor is quite beautiful.

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:35.190
Beautiful? Where?

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:36.040
I don't see it.

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:37.190
How could you not see it?

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:38.620
Are you okay?

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:40.630
What are you doing?

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.500
Looking at your hand,

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.230
you won't be able
to cook for a few days.

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:46.500
How about I order
some takeout for you these days?

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:48.060
Can you show some sincerity?

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.262
I don't eat takeout anyway.

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:51.740
What's the matter?

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:54.580
I could even come to your place
and cook for you.

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:57.150
You cook for me?

00:31:57.817 --> 00:31:58.790
That's not impossible.

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.100
But you know,
I don't like people entering my house.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:04.540
Because once you enter,

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:06.500
the whole room feels stuffy.

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:08.020
What do you mean?

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:11.260
How can the air get stuffy
just because I enter?

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:13.060
Alright, how about this?

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.470
After you cook,
just deliver it to my apartment.

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:16.310
What do you think?

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:22.060
Thank you so much.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:24.580
Go away.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.030
Mr. Yu, do you usually

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:34.810
buy so many random things?

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:35.720
Of course not.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.670
But today, there's you.

00:32:37.084 --> 00:32:38.440
I'm helping you out of kindness.

00:32:38.462 --> 00:32:40.470
Treating me like a laborer?
What about my overtime pay?

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:41.500
Weren't you volunteering?

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:43.670
I knew it.

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.030
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.950
Did you come to deliver food for me?

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.390
Is there meat?

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.230
I...

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.470
Um, hello.

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:57.500
I'm Shen Wu, nicknamed Wu.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:58.540
I'm Mr. Yu's assistant.

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:00.340
Hello, I'm Gu Yejia.

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.670
So you're Dr. Gu.

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:06.260
Mr. Yu talks about you a lot.

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:11.100
Mr. Yu talks about me often... How so?

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.190
Yeah, how do I talk about her?

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:22.020
- Hey, Jia.
- Yeah...

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:23.100
Hello.

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:24.070
Xiaoman.

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:26.190
Sorry, I came to the wrong place.

00:33:28.351 --> 00:33:29.506
You go in and sit first.

00:33:29.528 --> 00:33:31.750
My drain is blocked.
The property management isn't answering.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.630
Okay.

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:36.310
Hello.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:37.660
What's up?

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:38.990
Um...

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:41.430
My drain is blocked,

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:43.240
and the property management
isn't answering.

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.950
Do you know someone who can fix it?

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:46.190
Yes, him.

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:47.750
Ah?

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:49.870
Then I'll trouble you.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:50.940
No trouble at all.

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.060
I'll go help her fix it.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:53.900
Suit yourself.

00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:39.230
All done.

00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:41.990
You really know
what you're doing. Thanks.

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:47.350
Your clothes got wet.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:51.790
The wind will dry them.

00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:53.350
But then you'll catch a cold.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.900
Why not take it off and air it a bit?

00:34:54.951 --> 00:34:55.910
And join us for dinner.

00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:58.750
That, that's not appropriate.

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:00.220
What's inappropriate about it?

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.830
I just need a man to taste my cooking.

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:39.990
You two are skilled.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:41.790
All the dishes were made by Xiaoman.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:43.540
Well...

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:46.310
Um, Xiaoman,

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:49.100
I want to apologize to you.

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:51.420
Apologize?

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:52.670
Why apologize?

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:57.350
The last time at the restaurant,
didn't I embarrass you?

00:35:57.350 --> 00:35:58.190
Sorry about that.

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.220
Did he say anything to you?

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:02.060
Oh, no, nothing.

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:03.062
He didn't say anything.

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:04.910
Spreading rumors.

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:06.750
No, don't misunderstand.

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:09.430
I'm really not targeting you
or saying anything about you.

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:10.910
I was just venting about him.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:12.420
Alas...

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:14.140
(A one-handed dinner)

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.020
(really hard to swallow.)

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.180
(I shouldn't have done those pull-ups.)

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.900
(Mom)

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:26.110
Hey, Mom.

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.180
Dao, I made you stewed ribs.

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.710
- Come eat.
- I'm not coming.

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:31.830
That's fine too.

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:32.990
Then go with a friend.

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.540
Don't eat alone.

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:36.950
Online it says eating alone often

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:38.350
can affect mental health.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:40.340
Goodbye.

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:46.870
Honestly, I really admire you.

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:48.430
You're so meticulous with your money.

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.620
How is he meticulous with money?

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:54.390
I want to learn from him.

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:57.020
I'm a bit embarrassed to say it.

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.700
Let me explain. Simply put,

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.500
he organized a bulk purchase

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.870
for everyone at the restaurant,

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.100
turning a 500 yuan meal into 64 yuan.

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:11.750
Wow, it really feels nice
to have someone

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:12.790
to eat with.

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:14.750
Yeah, eating alone is so lonely.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:17.100
Unlike some people,

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.790
who don't say a word while eating.

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:20.020
Honestly, such weird people,

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.100
who can put up with him?

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:23.950
Bear with him?

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.340
Ms. Lin.

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:33.310
Oh, is that the one who brought him
to the hospital today?

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.470
- The one with glasses?
- Yes.

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:36.500
- That's her.
- Oh.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.620
Who? His girlfriend?

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:40.350
No, they're just close buddies.
No way they're dating.

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:46.140
Mr. Yu can't have
always been single, right?

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:47.230
Of course not.

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.617
He's been dumped many times.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:50.870
But nobody knows why.

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.060
Starting this early today.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.660
What?

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:08.020
You're too loud.

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:10.430
Because you guys are laughing so loudly.

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:13.270
What's so funny?

00:38:13.395 --> 00:38:16.284
Are you laughing because the person
who brought the food cooked badly?

00:38:16.306 --> 00:38:17.540
The person you're talking about

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.660
asked if you wanted
to come over and eat.

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:22.150
I already ate.

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:23.460
Hmph.

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:24.790
Xia Xiaoman said,

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.310
you started the music earlier today,

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:28.750
so you didn't actually eat.

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:29.950
Are you coming or not?

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:32.900
Not coming.

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:42.580
What did you bring?

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:45.910
Chive and fennel juice.

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:47.350
This tastes awful.

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:52.950
Who could drink this? Oh my god.

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:54.460
I can.

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:56.620
Green, so healthy.

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:01.950
You're impressive. I admit I was wrong.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:05.270
But did my food taste good?

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:06.710
Terrible.

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:07.710
The rice is too hard.

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:09.950
Mr. Yu,

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:11.580
have some manners.

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:13.830
Hey.

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:16.270
These buns look good.

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:17.540
I made them.

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:22.270
Ah, forget it. Don't mind him.

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:23.395
Let's talk about our stuff.

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.020
Xiaoman, you just said

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.060
that dating is like driving a car.

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:29.390
Yes.

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:32.700
Dating is like driving
without a license,

00:39:32.817 --> 00:39:34.140
just crashing through everything,

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.306
hitting things by chance.

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:38.100
Life doesn't come with a dating license.

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:40.500
I think, Jia,

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.470
you're the kind of person
who drives safely.

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:47.350
I haven't driven my car
for seven or eight years.

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:49.470
It's been gathering dust in the garage.

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:52.580
I don't even know if I could drive it
on the road again.

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:53.700
What does that mean?

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.060
It means you should drive it
around more often.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.620
That way it won't rust.

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:01.100
Exactly. Old cars need to be driven.

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.390
Otherwise, they'll rust.

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:05.100
No way.

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.830
Ah?

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:07.830
What do you mean?

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:10.270
Cars basically
start rusting after a year,

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:11.870
even if kept in a garage.

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:13.950
A seven or eight-year-old car

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:15.470
would be completely rusted.

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:17.430
Basically,

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:18.700
it's considered scrap.

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:21.180
There's no hope of driving it.

00:40:21.306 --> 00:40:22.990
But if you want to use it as decoration,

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:24.660
you could still repurpose it.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:26.580
Scrap, huh?

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:28.580
No hope left, huh?

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:29.700
Yeah.

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.950
Or you could just
throw it away like trash.

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:42.100
You're the trash.

00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:59.330
- What's wrong?
- Mr. Yu!

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:00.950
How can you say that about Dr. Gu?

00:41:00.973 --> 00:41:03.100
No, I... I was talking about the car.
Why is she angry?

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:03.990
You went off-topic.

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:05.180
We weren't talking about a car.

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:06.540
It's a metaphor for dating.

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.380
What?

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:09.950
Hurry up and go apologize.

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.500
You have to say, "Gu Yejia, I'm sorry."

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:13.620
Say it a few times.

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.830
What does a car have to do with dating?

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:37.900

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.540
(Fresh fruits, feel free to pick.)

(Fresh fruits, feel free to pick.)

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:07.100
