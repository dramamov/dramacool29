(Man City, Pacific Island Nation)

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:54.060
Honey.

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:55.640
I know you love quiet.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.359
I chose this place. Not bad, right?

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:58.420
Darling.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.100
Thank you.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:00.899
I really like this place.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.280
Tranquil and elegant.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.780
Hello.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.680
We're checking in.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.280
One moment.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.420
You like it?

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.200
Yeah.

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:31.760
Honey.

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:33.980
Why do you look so pale?

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.400
Maybe from sitting
in the car too long today.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.140
A bit tired.

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.859
It's fine.

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.280
We'll soak in the hot springs.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.024
It's comfortable.

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:42.159
Okay.

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:43.519
Is it done?

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:44.239
Yes.

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.959
Thank you.

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:45.459
My pleasure.

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:45.980
Let's go.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.200
Go.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.739
Darling.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.739
What's got you

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:04.120
so captivated?

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.840
Enjoying the view.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.900
The scenery here

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.780
is one-of-a-kind.

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:08.740
They say

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.080
the hot springs are good.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.000
We'll have a good soak later.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.240
Good.

(Women's Locker Room)

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.979
Wait.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.080
I'll wait.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.139
I'm going in.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.419
Honey.

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:41.740
Honey, are you okay?

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.659
Yes.

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:44.479
I just

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.699
accidentally touched a bug.

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:46.639
I've killed it.

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:48.840
Do you need help getting in?

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.840
Don't!

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:50.659
Don't.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.580
Women's locker room.

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:53.472
It's improper.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.599
Get changed.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.460
I'll wait by the hot spring pool.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.340
Okay.

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:59.199
I'll be there.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.099
Let go!

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.180
How dare you reject me?

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:07.860
Tell me,

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.139
have you fallen for that loser?

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.936
Yes.

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.819
Ye Dong,

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.020
we cut ties long ago.

00:03:16.192 --> 00:03:16.699
Moreover,

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:18.780
I'm having his baby.

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:22.699
You're lying.

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:24.819
You can only be mine.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.060
Mine!

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:28.960
Bai Cha.

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:30.464
Listen.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.099
Get rid of that child.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.432
Immediately.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.259
Right now.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.340
Okay?

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:39.639
Absolutely not.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.340
We've been over for a long time.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.060
And...

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.259
this child is my life.

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:53.979
I'm not the same person anymore.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.340
I'm about to take over

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.099
the entire Lin family business empire.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.939
By then,

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.300
money,

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.139
power,

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:05.740
anything you desire,

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:07.900
I can give it to you.

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:09.500
That way,

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.580
we can be together forever.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.900
Just like before.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.060
Believe me.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:17.980
Ye Dong,

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.220
please stop.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.019
Don't keep doing these evil deeds.

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:25.220
Evil deeds?

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.680
Money, luxury goods,

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:29.500
villas, estates,

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.620
standing above all and being admired.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.379
Weren't those what you wanted most

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:35.839
when we were together?

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.100
What?

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.259
Now, you've met some gentle guy,

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.060
and you want a peaceful life,

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.100
playing house and raising kids?

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.459
Let me tell you.

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:51.139
No way.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.860
You can only be mine.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.100
If

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.139
you don't abort this child,

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:06.540
I'll do it myself.

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:26.019
Thank you so much for earlier.

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:27.040
Happy to help.

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:28.139
Just a small favor.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.560
Glad you're okay.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.319
Honey.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.100
Your...

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.100
Darling.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.300
This is...

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:37.339
Darling.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.300
I accidentally fell earlier,

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.680
and this gentleman helped me up.

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:43.139
I'm Ye Dong.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.620
This is my wife, Lin Xia.

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:46.740
Thank you for helping her.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.040
Hello.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.139
I'm Cheng Nuo.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.459
Just glad she is okay.

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:52.620
Are you here alone, Mr. Cheng?

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:53.620
A bit quiet

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:55.339
for just two people in the hot springs.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.420
More people,

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:57.180
more fun.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.600
Fancy meeting you here.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.459
Mr. Cheng,

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:00.100
why not join us?

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.100
Sure.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.839
I came with my wife.

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:03.519
Darling.

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.879
What's it?

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.660
Perfect timing.

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:09.639
These are some new friends.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.579
This is Ye Dong.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:12.540
And this is...

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.459
This is my wife,

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:14.480
Lin Xia.

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:15.779
Hello.

00:06:20.579 --> 00:06:21.079
Hello.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.899
I'm Bai Cha.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.019
Come on.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:35.779
Since fate

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:36.660
brought us here,

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:38.259
let's toast

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:39.980
to our encounter

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.060
and to the good times

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:41.860
ahead.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.480
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.579
Cheers.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.500
Honey.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.360
Look,

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.579
your favorite steak.

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:55.860
Perfect medium-rare.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.740
Your beloved black pepper sauce.

00:06:57.939 --> 00:06:58.439
Here.

00:06:58.459 --> 00:06:58.959
Eat a lot.

00:07:04.019 --> 00:07:04.779
What's wrong?

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.139
Is everything alright?

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.180
Nothing.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:09.740
I slipped my grip.

00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:30.019
Are you okay, honey?

00:07:31.579 --> 00:07:32.079
Yes.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.819
Just feeling a bit unwell.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.379
I'll go to the restroom.

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:37.740
Let me accompany you.

00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:39.319
No need.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:40.139
I'll be back.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.500
Oh, honey,

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:48.899
I remembered the special sauce

00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:50.060
in our car.

00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:51.620
It'll be perfect with steak.

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:52.500
I'll go get it.

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:53.459
Go ahead.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:07:59.660
Cheers.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.180
Cheers.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.279
Mr. Cheng,

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.420
you clearly treat your wife very well.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.339
I think

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.079
a wife

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.500
should be pampered.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.000
By the way,

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.180
I feel Mr. Ye

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.019
treats you well, too.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.500
He's so attentive.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:18.420
It's enviable.

00:08:19.796 --> 00:08:24.182
(Public Restroom)

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.340
What do you want?

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.220
This is a restroom.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.100
Ye Dong.

00:08:46.539 --> 00:08:47.059
Let go!

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.259
Are you crazy?

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.019
Our spouses are both out there.

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:54.100
Crazy.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.419
Yes.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:58.940
I am crazy.

00:09:00.419 --> 00:09:02.259
I can't stand seeing you and that loser

00:09:03.379 --> 00:09:05.220
flaunting your love in front of me.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.259
And I can't stand him touching you.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:22.899
You are mine.

00:09:24.539 --> 00:09:25.299
From your head

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:26.620
to your toes,

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.059
every inch belongs to me.

00:09:31.899 --> 00:09:33.659
You will only ever be mine.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:35.740
Don't.

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:37.220
Ye Dong,

00:09:38.059 --> 00:09:39.059
I'm begging you.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.759
We'll get caught.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:45.984
Mrs. Ye,

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:47.899
I think my wife's been gone too long.

00:09:47.899 --> 00:09:48.700
I'm getting worried.

00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:49.500
I'll go check.

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:50.379
Go ahead.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.500
Excuse me for a moment.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.360
Why hasn't my husband returned yet?

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.000
No.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.639
No.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.139
Look,

00:10:33.019 --> 00:10:34.500
my wife's calling.

00:10:35.899 --> 00:10:36.700
Should I

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.580
answer it?

00:10:40.799 --> 00:10:41.408
No.

00:10:41.659 --> 00:10:42.740
Let her find out

00:10:43.659 --> 00:10:44.860
what we're doing here.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:46.368
No.

00:10:50.259 --> 00:10:51.059
I'm begging you.

00:10:52.259 --> 00:10:52.779
No.

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:55.960
Honey?

00:10:59.179 --> 00:10:59.899
Honey?

00:11:02.179 --> 00:11:02.899
Honey?

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:06.580
Honey?

00:11:10.779 --> 00:11:11.419
Honey?

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:15.779
Honey?

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.019
Answer me,

00:11:17.019 --> 00:11:17.740
or I'm coming in.

00:11:18.059 --> 00:11:18.659
Honey?

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.360
I heard you.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.700
Did you fall?

00:11:22.139 --> 00:11:23.379
N-N-No, I'm fine.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.059
Just a stomachache.

00:11:25.259 --> 00:11:26.279
I'll be out soon.

00:11:26.879 --> 00:11:27.399
Stomachache?

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.899
Let's go to the hospital then.

00:11:29.059 --> 00:11:29.980
Open the door.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:31.860
N-N-No need.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.059
I'll be better.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.419
I'll wait by the door.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.100
Hurry up.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.016
Okay.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:39.139
Okay.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:13.759
Darling.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:15.799
Honey.

00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:17.500
You finally came out.

00:12:17.899 --> 00:12:18.700
I was worried sick.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.460
Does your stomach still hurt?

00:12:21.899 --> 00:12:22.528
No.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:25.620
Honey, your neck...

00:12:27.019 --> 00:12:27.940
Allergy again.

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.100
Glad you're okay.

00:12:40.139 --> 00:12:40.740
Honey?

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.220
What's wrong, honey?

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:02.159
Why are you so flustered?
