00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.840
There are some here too.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.240
Come and get it, quick!

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.560
Come over here!

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.720
There are more on this side.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.560
They're all mine.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.760
They're all mine.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.720
All of these are mine.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.560
Give it back to me.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.240
Mine.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.240
I'll kill you.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.200
I'll kill you.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.920
I'll kill you.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.000
They're all mine.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.880
They're all mine.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.120
Go to hell!

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.360
Don't fight with me.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.400
Jiu Ye, go to hell!

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.760
Jiu Ye.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.760
Have you forgotten Jiu'er?

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.120
How can you be so cruel?

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.160
Jiu'er, why is it you?

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.200
Why are you here?

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.080
Why are you like this, Jiu'er?

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.200
Jiu Ye.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.840
Why do you want to kill me?

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.720
Don't you love Jiu'er anymore?

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.800
You betrayed me.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.160
You.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.440
If I could kill you once,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.120
I can kill you a second time.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.160
Enxi.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.120
Where's the stuff?

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.000
Where is it? Where is it?

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.080
The stuff.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.240
Where is it? Where is it?

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.960
Enxi.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.080
My stuff is gone.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.320
My stuff is gone.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.880
Where's the compass?

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.720
Did you take it? Did you take it?

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.960
I can't find the stuff.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.360
I've looked everywhere, can't find it.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.640
You took it.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.800
You took it, Jiu Ye. I didn't.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.720
I didn't steal it. I can't find it.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.080
You took it. Give it back.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.160
I didn't take it.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.520
Jiu Ye.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.080
Jiu... you.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.440
Jiu Ye.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.080
Jiu Ye.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.320
Give me the compass.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.800
It's our turn to get rich.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.800
I don't have the compass.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.960
Don't come closer.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.320
I don't have the compass.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.720
Don't come closer.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.880
Jiu Ye.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.240
I told you before,

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.520
someone wants to steal your stuff.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.800
Cui En.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.440
Jiu Ye, you're awake.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.520
Jiu Ye.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.520
I found some mushrooms in the woods.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.320
I made some soup.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.240
Drink it while it's hot.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.720
Enxi.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.720
Thank you for your hard work.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.080
Not at all.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.640
Thanks to Jiu Ye for saving me yesterday.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.000
Of course I had to save you.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.440
You're always loyal to me.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.800
I didn't just save you.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.160
I'll take you to enjoy wealth and glory.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.800
Thank you, Jiu Ye.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.720
Then I'll get back to work.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.040
Jiu Ye.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.920
Look.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.480
Azure Dragon Ridge.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.040
That's right.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.640
That's it.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.040
Let's go.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.480
You should eat something.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.160
You haven't eaten since yesterday.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.200
Your body can't take it.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.040
Hai... Haiyue.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.320
This trip probably won't end well for us.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.720
No, no.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.760
That's not what I meant.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.200
I mean,

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.320
on this trip,

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.200
we don't know what will happen next.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.040
Did I say something wrong again?

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.480
I know what you mean.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.640
No, you don't.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.040
I have a lot I want to tell you.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.640
I'm afraid if I don't say it now,

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.760
I won't get another chance.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.320
Haiyue.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.040
I... I've been an orphan since I was little.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.520
I've never seen my parents since birth.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.040
But I was lucky.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.760
Sometimes villagers gave me food.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.480
Sometimes I dug through trash

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.480
to find something to eat.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.760
I survived, somehow.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.880
Later, traffickers sold me as a blood slave.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.480
I thought that was my fate.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.520
I'd die in there sooner or later.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.200
But luckily, I met Brother Jin.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.200
And met Chief Luo.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.480
And then I met you.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.040
I felt I wouldn't die anymore.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.480
I even found a family.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:08.920
Haiyue.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.760
I'm not as good as you.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.760
You know how to hunt ginseng.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.920
You can heal people.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.040
You're even a chieftainess.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.760
If Brother Jin hadn't helped me,

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.320
I'd be nothing now.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.440
Haiyue.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:31.760
I...

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:33.800
I...

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.080
I just want to keep looking at you.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.320
Seeing you smile makes me so happy.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.920
I just want to stay by your side.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:44.880
Watching you.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.440
Yan Baobao.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.480
You have to keep your word.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.440
From now on, you must always look at me.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.640
Stay by my side.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.320
Don't leave me, not even a step.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:47.680
Here.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:38.960
Brother Jinzi.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.000
Where should we go next?

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.760
Azure Dragon Ridge.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.080
Jiu Ye, look.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.320
The shelter Jin Shisan built last time.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.840
I see it.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.120
Go a bit further and you'll reach
Azure Dragon Ridge.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.080
I checked the terrain here
early this morning.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.520
The area stretches for over
ten kilometers.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.680
It's all cliffs and steep walls.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.320
But there's something unusual
about this place.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.320
Baobao.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.560
Do you remember the Homage
of the Forest?

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.440
It's when every plant and tree

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.640
grows in the same direction.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:29.520
That's right.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.080
It's like this for miles
all around.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.200
Even more amazing than when
we dug up the Shenlong Incense.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.080
It's even more astonishing.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.440
They say the Ginseng King
is about to appear.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.640
It comes once every sixty cycles.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.440
Looks like the Ginseng King
will show up soon.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.200
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.400
Go!

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.080
What a pity.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.080
Jiu Ye.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.280
Drop your gun.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.640
Tingxuan, my nephew.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.400
What are you doing?

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.640
You old bastard.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.880
You're hard to kill.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.000
Even poison couldn't finish you.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.200
What poison?

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.440
Underworld Mushroom.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.640
To send you down
the road to hell.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.640
Shame about that pot of soup.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.440
But killing that witch Enxi
was worth it.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.520
It was worth it.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:04.760
Nephew.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.080
Look here.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.000
Your father and I were sworn brothers.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.400
I watched you grow up.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:12.560
What do you want?

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.080
Tell your uncle.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.080
What do I want?

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.880
You ask me what I want?

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.640
I want you to give Jiu'er
back to me.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.640
Can you do that?

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.640
You killed her.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.880
You killed her yourself.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.760
Nephew.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.000
All for a woman?

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.440
Do you really know her?

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.400
Do you understand her?

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.280
She doesn't know
what love is.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.520
She only cares about
your family name.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.320
If you were poor,

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.640
she wouldn't even look at you.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.440
Bullshit!

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.520
Listen, old man—

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.000
I'm the only one
in her heart.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.080
Only me.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.000
We agreed—

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.440
Once we found the ginseng,
we'd run away together.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.640
Yang Laoba.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.840
You raised a lovesick fool.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.880
Do you know why

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.520
the position went
to your sister?

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.880
Because you're useless,
just useless.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:17.640
You—

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.000
I'm the true heir
of the Yang family. Say it!

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.320
You're useless. Say it!

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.440
Who am I?

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.560
Who am I?

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.440
I'm the Yang family heir.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.520
You're the Yang family heir.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.000
You're the Yang family heir. I am—

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.200
You're the Yang family heir. I am—

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.760
I am—go to hell!

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:01.760
Enxi.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.960
Enxi. Enxi.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.440
Enxi, what's wrong?

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.440
I'll find a way
to save you, sister.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:18.760
Sis.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.640
Don't bother.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.840
You're so smart—

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.320
You know there's no saving me.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.000
Come on, get up.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.200
Get up.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:32.880
Sis.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.080
I'm sorry.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.400
I was wrong.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.840
Yang Tingxuan.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.280
Yang Tingxuan.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.200
Yang Tingxuan, wake up!

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.440
You drank too much again.

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.200
Yang Tingxuan, wake up.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.000
Wake up.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.200
Wake up!

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:20.640
Brother.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.200
Brother.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.440
Brother, wake up!

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.840
Brother.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Brother.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:37.640
Brother.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.880
Mom and Dad died young.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.080
It's always been just us
since we were kids.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.200
We suffered so much
from others.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.400
I won't let them
step on us anymore.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.200
We're all born human.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.520
Why should we be
less than anyone else?

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.840
I refuse to accept this fate.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.760
I'll decide my own destiny.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.080
I want to rise above
all of them.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.400
I want—I...

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:09.440
Mm.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:10.640
Enxi.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.920
You're my good sister.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.800
But kindness only
gets you bullied.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.400
We, the two daughters
of the Cui family—

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.400
can't both be weak
and gentle.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.400
I want the Cui Ginseng Shop
to thrive too.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.040
Sis.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:35.920
Sis.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:43.560
I can see that fool
treats you well.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.040
I really envy you.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:47.760
Sis.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.400
I can't stay with you
anymore.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.520
Take care of yourself.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.040
I didn't take good care
of you, sister.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.040
Sister—sis.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:03.560
Here.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.560
I think I see Father.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:17.280
Enxi. Enxi. Enxi.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.320
Enxi. Enxi.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.320
That Jiu Ye—

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.440
is truly ruthless.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.040
Take them away.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.120
Yes, yes.
