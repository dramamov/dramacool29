00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:40.959
The day we first arrived in the village

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.159
we ran into a heavy rain.

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:44.080
We took shelter in the Asura Temple.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.959
Dad, come in quickly!

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:47.639
But I lost my bracelet.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.319
My mom made it for me herself.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.599
So a few days later,

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:54.759
I sneaked into the Asura Temple again.

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:56.279
I wanted to find it.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.400
Ghost!

00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:21.919
Ghost!

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.800
Ghost!

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:39.519
My name is Qian Duoduo.

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:41.040
What's your name?

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:46.239
Where did this fool come from?

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:48.480
Aren't you afraid of me?

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:54.239
Did I break this too?

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.120
This wound is twenty years old.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.680
It's still so obvious.

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:05.239
Does it still hurt?

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.199
Fools like you

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:09.080
will be eaten by Blood Yan Luo sooner or later.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.240
Who's Blood Yan Luo?

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.960
He eats children.

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:16.639
I don't believe that.

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:18.759
There aren't that many bad people in the world.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.000
Like you, for example.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.919
Lots of people outside say you're

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.839
the man-eating evil god, Asura.

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:25.919
But you're clearly a good person.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:27.880
A good person.

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:32.119
Little one.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.479
Do you know how many people I've killed

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:35.800
just to find Blood Yan Luo?

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:37.080
Well...

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.039
Get lost.

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:39.839
I'm not in the mood

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.440
to play house with a brat who knows nothing of the world.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.039
Play house.

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.919
Get lost.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.839
Stop trying to scare me.

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:49.880
Blood Yan Luo, huh?

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.720
Asura.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.639
You found the only keepsake my mom left me.

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:55.240
And you gave me roast chicken.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.479
You're a good person.

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.960
You're my only friend here.

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.679
I'll come find you again tomorrow anyway.

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:03.000
Don't come.

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.880
I won't be here.

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:07.559
The next day, when I went to find him,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.240
he was there, just as I thought.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.559
We really became friends.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.880
After that, I often snuck out to play with him.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.119
Wait outside.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.320
I'll be right there.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.240
That night,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.360
I snuck out again to play with him.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.080
But halfway there, Doctor Cui caught me.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.360
Eat.

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:34.440
Stop struggling.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.520
No one will come to save you.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.240
Help! Help!

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:52.880
Help!

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.919
You're the one who's been

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:13.279
looking for me, that strange man.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.200
That kid

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:30.679
was poisoned by datura.

00:04:31.359 --> 00:04:32.160
In the woods behind the mountain

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:34.079
there are herbs that can cure him.

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:35.799
If you don't go soon,

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:37.760
that kid will die.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.679
Brother.

00:04:39.679 --> 00:04:41.160
We're finally home.

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:42.359
Don't worry, An An.

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:44.200
No one will ever bully us again.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.959
Will Mom and Dad forget me?

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:48.040
Of course not.

00:04:48.359 --> 00:04:49.519
Mom must have already made

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:50.799
your favorite osmanthus cake.

00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:51.839
It's waiting for you at home.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.720
Let's go.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.559
My stomach hurts so much.

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:15.799
Am I going to die?

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:16.959
Don't fall asleep.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.079
Didn't you want to know my name?

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:21.399
My name is Kang Kang.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.920
Wake up, silly boy.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.480
A Kang.

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:28.519
Tell me a story.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.000
Every time my mom tells me a story,

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.119
I feel better.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.000
Don't push your luck.

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:37.200
No story.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.600
I'm about to fall asleep.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.320
Once upon a time, there was a little boy

00:05:45.799 --> 00:05:46.880
who lived with his parents

00:05:47.359 --> 00:05:49.640
and his younger brother.

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:51.519
In their yard,

00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:54.920
there was a big osmanthus tree.

00:05:55.679 --> 00:05:57.320
When autumn came,

00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:00.000
golden osmanthus flowers would bloom.

00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:01.440
The whole yard would smell wonderful.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.079
Every time that happened,

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:06.559
his mom would make

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:09.160
the best osmanthus cake in the world.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.959
That little boy

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:15.079
and his brother loved it most.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.359
It was osmanthus cake.

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:18.880
A Kang.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.959
What's your brother's name?

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.519
I'm not five years old.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.600
You think I'd fall for that?

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.000
An An.

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:40.399
My brother's name is An An.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.160
Little one.

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:57.040
You've slept so long.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.320
A Kang.

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:04.760
What's wrong with you?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.959
I might not be able to take you home.

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:12.399
Little one.

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:14.720
What will you do?

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:15.760
This...

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.399
What if you run into bad people again?

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.839
Duoduo.

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:22.559
Young Master Qian.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.799
Duoduo.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.799
That's great!

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.320
Your dad is here.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.760
It's really my dad.

00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:31.279
Wait for me here.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.200
I'll go get them to save you.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.200
Duoduo.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.000
From now on, stay with me.

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:38.079
I'll be your little brother.

00:07:38.079 --> 00:07:38.839
Duoduo.

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:40.079
You have to wait for me.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.920
Go! Hurry!

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.760
Little brother.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.200
In this messed-up world,

00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:14.480
how is there still a fool like you?

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:26.600
Asura.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.760
That Asura is coming!

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.679
Shoot him!

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:29.880
Shoot him!

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.200
No!

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:30.920
Stop it now!

00:08:57.119 --> 00:08:58.840
Finally, this time

00:09:01.799 --> 00:09:02.679
An An

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.159
was still

00:09:09.039 --> 00:09:12.679
in time

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.280
This is osmanthus cake

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.719
You’ll probably like it

00:09:33.479 --> 00:09:35.080
You really are like He Fuyi said

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.640
able to come and go freely in the lamp

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.280
He Fuyi said

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.960
not to poke your nose into things

00:09:51.159 --> 00:09:52.159
I don’t understand

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.119
In A Kang’s dream

00:09:54.239 --> 00:09:56.359
why does he look like his childhood self

00:09:56.559 --> 00:09:57.239
And how could he

00:09:57.239 --> 00:09:59.479
for a friend he barely knows

00:09:59.559 --> 00:10:01.760
give up the chance to take revenge

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.080
even

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.840
sacrifice his life

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.320
Actually,

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.039
he’s always trapped in his childhood nightmare

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.520
always stuck in

00:10:12.799 --> 00:10:14.880
that moment he couldn’t save An An

00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:16.919
The nightmare haunts him

00:10:17.239 --> 00:10:18.719
so for the next twenty years

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.440
he lived only for revenge

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.799
Every time he closes his eyes

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.520
he’s back to that helpless

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.960
childhood self

00:10:27.359 --> 00:10:28.559
So,

00:10:29.039 --> 00:10:31.000
saving Qian Duoduo desperately

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.440
was to make up for his regret

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.119
and to redeem himself

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.760
the self that never found peace

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.119
Did you see your mother and An An?

00:10:49.479 --> 00:10:50.520
In the next life

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.599
you must live happily and safely

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.960
It’s A Kang’s spirit aura

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:12.960
Nice!

00:11:40.239 --> 00:11:40.919
There’s word

00:11:40.919 --> 00:11:42.679
the Empress Dowager’s health is poor lately

00:11:43.039 --> 00:11:45.239
her close aides have sought out He Fuyi

00:11:46.559 --> 00:11:47.520
Lord Zhuang means

00:11:48.159 --> 00:11:49.520
we must do whatever it takes

00:11:50.359 --> 00:11:51.799
to stop the Empress Dowager from getting the Seven Stars Lamp

00:11:52.479 --> 00:11:54.359
Lan Hai Society has worked for years

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.559
just to remove the Empress Dowager

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.280
and support the Emperor’s rise

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.640
to carry out new policies

00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:02.280
If the Empress Dowager gets the Seven Stars Lamp now

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.400
for you

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.159
it’s truly no good

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.559
Ten years ago, we fought hard for the lamp

00:12:09.039 --> 00:12:10.919
and struck hard at Zhenhuan Escort Agency

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.960
forcing Lord Zhuang to flee west

00:12:14.479 --> 00:12:15.440
I don’t get it

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.960
The Seven Stars Life-Extending Lamp is just a legend

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.919
Does it really grant longer life?

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.559
The Southern Dipper controls life

00:12:24.039 --> 00:12:25.119
The Northern Dipper controls death

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.440
The Seven Stars Life-Extending Method

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.119
has been passed down since ancient times

00:12:29.919 --> 00:12:31.080
Some succeeded

00:12:31.599 --> 00:12:32.679
some failed

00:12:33.679 --> 00:12:34.479
This shows

00:12:34.719 --> 00:12:35.840
the life-extending method

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.679
isn’t foolproof

00:12:38.679 --> 00:12:40.719
Ten years ago, the Empress Dowager got it

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.880
but she might not have used it

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.159
But the problem is

00:12:45.599 --> 00:12:48.000
the Seven Stars Lamp is different now

00:12:48.599 --> 00:12:49.200
It’s kind of

00:12:49.719 --> 00:12:50.479
alive

00:12:50.799 --> 00:12:51.880
What do you mean, alive?

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.559
You and A Qi

00:12:58.559 --> 00:13:00.679
have been searching for something, right?

00:13:03.239 --> 00:13:04.640
We’ve been looking for someone

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:05.960
Who?

00:13:06.159 --> 00:13:07.599
Maybe I can help you find them

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.919
Able to enter the Seven Stars dream

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.679
A Qi says you have a familiar scent

00:13:19.119 --> 00:13:20.760
and you keep finding excuses to follow us

00:13:21.719 --> 00:13:23.000
But that doesn’t mean

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.880
I truly see you as one of us

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.479
or trust you this much

00:13:30.239 --> 00:13:31.960
But for many things

00:13:32.719 --> 00:13:34.239
you haven’t tried to avoid me

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.599
I carry a secret treasure

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.479
it’s normal for people to covet it

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:39.559
can’t be avoided

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.239
The fish is almost done

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.400
Logically speaking

00:13:48.719 --> 00:13:50.719
someone like you shouldn’t know this

00:13:52.719 --> 00:13:54.280
The year the foreigners attacked the city

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.840
I accompanied the Emperor and Empress Dowager west

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.479
We were covered in dust the whole way

00:13:59.479 --> 00:14:00.640
and suffered a lot

00:14:01.239 --> 00:14:02.880
Catching fish, roasting fish

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.119
I learned all that back then

00:14:05.359 --> 00:14:07.640
Then you’re a decent hostage

00:14:08.799 --> 00:14:10.719
Just worried I’d get hurt in the palace

00:14:10.719 --> 00:14:11.960
lose an arm or a leg

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.200
and couldn’t explain to my father

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.919
So on this journey

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.840
it won’t be peaceful

00:14:22.599 --> 00:14:23.359
Once,

00:14:23.599 --> 00:14:24.799
someone tried to assassinate us

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.440
I risked my life to save the Old Buddha

00:14:26.679 --> 00:14:28.479
I was half in the grave

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.599
Isn’t that miserable?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:37.880
Why are you laughing?

00:14:40.119 --> 00:14:41.280
But after that

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.880
my status soared

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.239
I became a favorite of the Old Buddha

00:14:48.799 --> 00:14:49.760
The fish is ready

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.599
Smells great, I want some too

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:08.840
Delicious

00:15:16.159 --> 00:15:16.679
Someone’s here

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.520
A Qi

00:15:18.919 --> 00:15:19.479
Go back

00:15:35.359 --> 00:15:35.880
Be careful

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:47.559
Sir

00:15:47.559 --> 00:15:48.159
I saw it

00:15:50.119 --> 00:15:51.400
These people are unknown

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.400
but not a threat

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:54.919
Listen to Young Master Wu

00:15:55.919 --> 00:15:56.919
Don’t show yourself rashly

00:16:10.239 --> 00:16:11.479
So it was a dream

00:16:11.479 --> 00:16:12.799
Scared me to death

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.520
Xiaoman

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.239
Husband

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.760
Help me

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.719
Dear

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:31.520
Is that you?
