ACROBATIC SHOW
FEMALE KNIFE THROWER

00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:31.146
Stop doing that and pour me a drink!

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.521
-That's right!
-Yeah!

00:00:32.605 --> 00:00:34.521
How long are you gonna keep
throwing those?

00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:36.313
Come here and drink with us!

00:00:36.396 --> 00:00:40.188
Nobody throws knives anymore anyway!

00:00:40.271 --> 00:00:41.980
You've got a pretty face.

00:00:42.063 --> 00:00:44.313
Take your clothes off and sing for us!

00:00:44.396 --> 00:00:45.271
Damn right!

00:00:45.355 --> 00:00:49.230
Show us your beautiful fair skin.
Pretty please!

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.771
CIVILIZATION AND ENLIGHTENMENT

00:00:57.855 --> 00:00:58.938
Bravo!

00:00:59.605 --> 00:01:01.563
That's impressive!

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:05.563
-I want a big one.
-Me too.

00:01:05.646 --> 00:01:07.646
I can't deal with this without good food.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.438
Can you raise my pay?

00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:12.105
The customers don't like it,
so stop your whining.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.605
Iroha.

00:01:14.688 --> 00:01:18.146
Why don't you sell those knives instead,
or start selling your body?

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.563
I don't mind paying for it.

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:26.605
What? What's that face for?

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:28.688
Huh?

00:01:30.605 --> 00:01:33.480
Have you forgotten who took you in?

00:01:33.563 --> 00:01:34.771
I'm talking to you.

00:01:40.146 --> 00:01:41.521
So you were alive.

00:01:43.146 --> 00:01:44.230
I'm glad.

00:01:46.063 --> 00:01:48.605
I didn't expect you
to be a traveling entertainer.

00:01:48.688 --> 00:01:50.396
It was hard to find you.

00:01:50.896 --> 00:01:52.855
I'm surprised you didn't get angry.

00:01:52.938 --> 00:01:56.188
The old Iroha
would've slashed them all to death.

00:01:57.188 --> 00:01:58.396
I'm used to it.

00:02:00.105 --> 00:02:01.313
What about you, Sansuke?

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:02.730
Well.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.146
I'm pulling a rickshaw every day
to feed my wife and daughter.

00:02:08.021 --> 00:02:11.021
I see. You have a family now.

00:02:11.105 --> 00:02:11.938
Yes.

00:02:12.438 --> 00:02:15.396
And you? What did you do
after you left the mountain?

00:02:18.688 --> 00:02:19.771
Many things.

00:02:20.563 --> 00:02:23.271
I moved from place to place,
hiding from Gentosai.

00:02:27.563 --> 00:02:28.813
And the others?

00:02:43.855 --> 00:02:46.521
Fugoro and Shichiya
were killed by Gentosai.

00:02:48.896 --> 00:02:51.730
He's been searching
for the surviving Kyohachi-ryu.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.355
Iroha.

00:02:56.146 --> 00:02:58.480
If we don't do something,
both of us will be killed.

00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:02.355
I already found Shikura and Jinroku
and convinced them.

00:03:02.438 --> 00:03:03.855
They're in the army now.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.230
What are you trying to do?

00:03:13.355 --> 00:03:16.521
We'll use this to draw Gentosai out
and kill him ourselves.

00:03:16.605 --> 00:03:19.813
Unless all of us attack together,
we won't be able to kill him.

00:03:21.146 --> 00:03:22.105
Iroha.

00:03:24.813 --> 00:03:27.021
This is our fate.

00:03:47.605 --> 00:03:49.063
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.063
And now, to discover
the true identity of Kodoku,

00:03:54.146 --> 00:03:56.063
it's time for
the great strategist Kyojin--

00:03:56.146 --> 00:03:58.188
Just get to the point.

00:04:01.105 --> 00:04:03.063
We're running two experiments.

00:04:03.146 --> 00:04:04.855
For the first one,

00:04:05.355 --> 00:04:09.105
we'll hand over a participant
with a wooden tag to the police.

00:04:11.438 --> 00:04:14.230
Once detained, they'll be held there
until the end of the game.

00:04:14.313 --> 00:04:16.021
They're basically out of the game.

00:04:16.105 --> 00:04:20.730
Normally, you can't
kill someone who's in jail.

00:04:20.813 --> 00:04:24.646
So the question is whether Kodoku
would still make a move?

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:25.771
Correct.

00:04:25.855 --> 00:04:29.188
Whether they would defy authority
to silence someone,

00:04:29.271 --> 00:04:32.355
or at least stop short
of interfering with the police…

00:04:32.938 --> 00:04:36.021
This will show us how far
the Kodoku organizer is willing to go.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.563
And for the second one,

00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:43.980
we'll find out
where the dead bodies disappear to.

00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:46.230
-Disappear?
-Yes.

00:04:46.896 --> 00:04:50.896
Dozens of people are killing each other
along the Tokaido Road.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.771
Surely there should be a dead body or two
lying there on the side of the road.

00:04:55.855 --> 00:04:56.938
However…

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.480
We haven't seen any dead bodies
that were killed in battle.

00:05:01.563 --> 00:05:02.896
Exactly.

00:05:06.938 --> 00:05:11.188
You know that the Kodoku
are monitoring the participants?

00:05:14.271 --> 00:05:17.521
Well, they won't follow us inside.

00:05:18.105 --> 00:05:20.396
But the Kodoku are watching us.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.938
So they're the ones
who dispose of the dead bodies?

00:05:25.021 --> 00:05:27.896
Yes. They must be taking them somewhere.

00:05:28.563 --> 00:05:29.730
Which means?

00:05:30.813 --> 00:05:32.480
They have manpower and hiding spots

00:05:32.563 --> 00:05:36.146
to dispose of bodies across different
locations without getting caught.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.771
Excellent answer.

00:05:38.313 --> 00:05:40.438
If we can find
where the dead bodies are taken,

00:05:40.521 --> 00:05:43.146
maybe we can figure out
who is behind this game.

00:05:44.646 --> 00:05:47.146
So? I'm quite a strategist, right?

00:05:50.813 --> 00:05:53.521
So? Where do we start?

00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:57.396
First, we hunt for a candidate
to hand over to the police.

00:06:30.605 --> 00:06:33.980
Why would the zaibatsu
procure over 100 rifles

00:06:34.063 --> 00:06:36.063
and make the shizoku kill each other?

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:37.896
Since the Meiji era started,

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.438
they've made a fortune
through government work.

00:06:42.063 --> 00:06:44.771
What do they possibly gain
from doing something like this?

00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:49.938
Using money as bait
to force the shizoku to kill each other…

00:06:51.188 --> 00:06:54.021
Couldn't it be that their slaughter
is the very goal itself?

00:06:58.396 --> 00:07:00.813
A grudge against the shizoku.

00:07:01.313 --> 00:07:05.230
They have long been tormented
by the shizoku's unreasonable extortion.

00:07:05.313 --> 00:07:07.730
According to the zaibatsu,

00:07:07.813 --> 00:07:12.730
the four in question
have been on leave since a week ago.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.688
No one knows their whereabouts,
and they're not at their homes.

00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:19.146
Find them immediately.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.063
Yes, sir.

00:07:20.563 --> 00:07:21.813
Lord Okubo, if I may,

00:07:21.896 --> 00:07:26.021
taking action against the zaibatsu
could affect our nation's economy--

00:07:26.105 --> 00:07:27.271
Shinpei.

00:07:27.355 --> 00:07:29.646
If they're the ones
pulling the strings behind this,

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.605
it will be considered high treason.

00:07:33.021 --> 00:07:35.355
We must deal with this at once.

00:07:36.771 --> 00:07:38.063
-Kawaji.
-Yes, sir?

00:07:38.146 --> 00:07:40.230
I want you to bring them here.

00:07:40.313 --> 00:07:42.980
I will locate their whereabouts
as soon as possible.

00:07:44.063 --> 00:07:46.355
-I'll start analyzing the telegrams.
-Yes.

00:07:57.605 --> 00:07:59.021
KUWANA-JUKU

00:07:59.105 --> 00:08:00.355
Come, come!

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:02.480
Grilled clams, Kuwana's specialty!

00:08:02.563 --> 00:08:04.646
Come and get your grilled clams!

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:09.813
We've got horse mackerels, clams,
bigfin reef squid, and delicious sake too!

00:08:10.313 --> 00:08:11.813
You must be tired from traveling.

00:08:11.896 --> 00:08:13.938
Would you like to take a short break here?

00:08:14.021 --> 00:08:15.563
Thank you very much.

00:08:15.646 --> 00:08:17.646
Customers coming in!

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.521
Welcome! A group of four coming in!

00:08:30.855 --> 00:08:34.396
Please go ahead!
We have a table in the back!

00:08:35.646 --> 00:08:38.021
Miss, fetch us some tea and skewers.

00:08:38.521 --> 00:08:40.938
Tea and four plates of skewers!

00:08:44.271 --> 00:08:47.063
Okay, one bowl of mixed rice!

00:08:48.063 --> 00:08:50.063
One flying squid!

00:08:55.896 --> 00:08:57.021
Look at that guy.

00:08:58.605 --> 00:09:01.563
He's not even hiding his wooden tag.
That's some confidence.

00:09:05.355 --> 00:09:06.855
They're participants too.

00:09:07.563 --> 00:09:09.021
I saw them at Tenryuji Temple.

00:09:11.563 --> 00:09:12.980
Which one should we go for?

00:09:13.063 --> 00:09:14.730
Don't mess me around!

00:09:14.813 --> 00:09:15.646
I'm sorry!

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.396
Useless, clumsy idiot!

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.521
I'm really sorry! I'm sorry!

00:09:19.605 --> 00:09:20.896
Shut it!

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.063
I'm sorry…

00:09:22.146 --> 00:09:24.021
Let's go with whoever leaves first.

00:09:27.605 --> 00:09:30.146
That won't be necessary.

00:09:35.521 --> 00:09:36.396
Who are you?

00:09:43.938 --> 00:09:45.980
So there was one more than I thought.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.521
"One more"? Hmm?

00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:50.938
What exactly do you mean?

00:09:53.438 --> 00:09:54.438
Huh?

00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:08.021
Most participants pass by this teahouse.

00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:12.521
So I took the liberty of setting a trap.

00:10:12.605 --> 00:10:15.771
Isn't it a violation of the rules to
tell non-participants about this?

00:10:15.855 --> 00:10:18.938
It's not a violation if I hire them
without giving them the details.

00:10:19.021 --> 00:10:20.688
So much for a strategist.

00:10:20.771 --> 00:10:22.355
This is nothing.

00:10:25.813 --> 00:10:26.813
As for the girls…

00:10:28.646 --> 00:10:31.771
Do as you please with them.

00:10:40.313 --> 00:10:43.521
Okay, carry on.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.063
YOKKAICHI-JUKU

00:10:56.146 --> 00:10:58.855
Yokkaichi's known for Banko ceramics!

00:10:58.938 --> 00:11:00.396
Come take a look!

00:11:07.605 --> 00:11:09.355
Lower-intermediate.

00:11:12.563 --> 00:11:13.938
A beginner.

00:11:19.105 --> 00:11:20.730
Pre-intermediate.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:39.896
Hey, you.

00:11:41.313 --> 00:11:43.063
You're a participant, aren't you?

00:11:44.355 --> 00:11:47.271
Have you seen a guy with a girl in tow?

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:49.730
No.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.188
Goddammit.

00:11:53.063 --> 00:11:56.396
After years of waiting,
this is what I get?

00:12:00.688 --> 00:12:01.730
A bow, huh?

00:12:02.396 --> 00:12:06.063
What's fun about shooting arrows
here and there from so far away?

00:12:06.646 --> 00:12:08.896
It's no different from a gun.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.855
This tool is used
to make offerings to the gods.

00:12:14.605 --> 00:12:15.688
It does not compare.

00:12:38.771 --> 00:12:40.896
To hell with the gods.

00:12:41.771 --> 00:12:43.146
What a joke.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.230
My dear!

00:12:45.813 --> 00:12:49.105
Oh no! Open your eyes, please!

00:12:49.188 --> 00:12:52.813
You monster… Please! Wake up…

00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:03.063
If gods were real…
the world would be different.

00:13:20.813 --> 00:13:21.688
Good.

00:13:26.146 --> 00:13:27.521
Let's play.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.188
Die, you bastard!

00:13:44.896 --> 00:13:46.855
Girls! Go for the girls!

00:13:46.938 --> 00:13:49.813
If you take their wooden tags,
I'll triple the pay!

00:14:20.355 --> 00:14:21.563
Move!

00:14:25.188 --> 00:14:27.230
Look who's caught now?

00:14:29.313 --> 00:14:31.438
What the hell's going on?

00:14:31.521 --> 00:14:32.938
This isn't what we were told!

00:14:33.021 --> 00:14:34.730
You can't leave. I'm paying you!

00:14:37.896 --> 00:14:38.813
Hey!

00:15:06.021 --> 00:15:08.980
Go! Hurry the hell up!

00:15:22.896 --> 00:15:25.063
Come on, go!

00:15:51.521 --> 00:15:53.105
Die!

00:16:14.688 --> 00:16:17.021
Someone! Go get the police!

00:16:18.355 --> 00:16:19.605
Out of the way!

00:16:52.063 --> 00:16:54.855
It's an offering to the gods.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:11.896
That's enough.

00:17:19.563 --> 00:17:21.480
Do I know you from somewhere?

00:17:21.563 --> 00:17:23.771
The police are on their way here.

00:17:23.855 --> 00:17:24.813
Yeah?

00:17:24.896 --> 00:17:26.313
So what?

00:17:26.396 --> 00:17:29.313
Those on the organizer's side
have high expectations for you two.

00:17:29.396 --> 00:17:31.480
Having you eliminated will spoil the game.

00:17:31.563 --> 00:17:33.646
You think I'll get caught?

00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:37.688
I can go ahead and cut you down here.

00:17:38.271 --> 00:17:39.688
Be my guest.

00:17:40.896 --> 00:17:43.855
If you think you can win
against this many rifles.

00:17:49.688 --> 00:17:51.021
I've lost interest.

00:18:00.521 --> 00:18:02.396
The times have changed.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.438
There's no place left
for the samurai to live.

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:10.605
You went through hell
after the war, didn't you?

00:18:13.271 --> 00:18:15.021
Bukotsu Kanjiya?

00:18:17.771 --> 00:18:20.230
It's none of your damn business.

00:18:51.021 --> 00:18:53.688
All right, then. Which one is it gonna be?

00:18:54.438 --> 00:18:58.105
What are you going to make us do?

00:18:58.188 --> 00:19:02.355
We're going to give one of you
to the police with your wooden tag.

00:19:02.938 --> 00:19:03.771
What?

00:19:05.313 --> 00:19:07.230
What? Wait a second…

00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:08.896
If you do that--

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.188
Kodoku will kill you,
or the police will protect you.

00:19:12.271 --> 00:19:13.521
One or the other.

00:19:14.063 --> 00:19:14.896
What?

00:19:15.896 --> 00:19:18.021
And the one who isn't given to the police?

00:19:18.105 --> 00:19:20.438
We grab his wooden tag,
and he drops out right here.

00:19:23.271 --> 00:19:24.896
Hand me over to the police!

00:19:25.938 --> 00:19:27.105
I-I'll go!

00:19:27.188 --> 00:19:28.188
What?

00:19:28.271 --> 00:19:31.188
I'm the one who's going.
You keep your mouth shut!

00:19:33.688 --> 00:19:36.271
Well, I'm afraid you're
dropping out here, young man.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.105
Please. I'll do anything!

00:19:43.188 --> 00:19:46.605
Just accept it.
You've killed plenty already too.

00:19:46.688 --> 00:19:48.480
I haven't killed anyone at all!

00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:51.646
Even at Tenryuji Temple,
I just picked up a tag someone dropped.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:53.188
I'm sure… No lies, please.

00:19:53.271 --> 00:19:54.605
I'm not lying!

00:19:56.188 --> 00:19:58.813
This man threatened me.

00:20:00.105 --> 00:20:02.146
He told me he'd at least keep me alive.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:03.730
Stop lying!

00:20:07.271 --> 00:20:08.855
I come from a poor family.

00:20:10.021 --> 00:20:12.605
I joined because I wanted
to help my father's business.

00:20:16.646 --> 00:20:18.105
But then…

00:20:20.855 --> 00:20:22.521
It was a killing game…

00:20:25.896 --> 00:20:27.563
and I just couldn't do it.

00:20:32.021 --> 00:20:32.855
I'm begging you.

00:20:35.188 --> 00:20:38.896
Please… Please spare my life!

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:47.438
You heard what he said.

00:20:55.855 --> 00:20:57.646
I guess you win.

00:20:59.646 --> 00:21:03.480
But you're gonna
lend me a hand in return, okay?

00:21:06.938 --> 00:21:08.438
Thank you.

00:21:11.063 --> 00:21:12.730
Thank you!

00:21:14.021 --> 00:21:14.855
What?

00:21:15.355 --> 00:21:16.688
Wait a minute.

00:21:16.771 --> 00:21:17.855
I can help you out too--

00:21:17.938 --> 00:21:21.105
Shujiro, you guys go and check
where the dead bodies are being taken.

00:21:21.188 --> 00:21:22.021
Okay.

00:21:22.605 --> 00:21:24.271
Oh, and you, Iroha.

00:21:25.105 --> 00:21:25.938
Here.

00:21:27.938 --> 00:21:28.980
What's this?

00:21:29.063 --> 00:21:30.396
It's a smoke ball.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.438
I don't need this.

00:21:32.521 --> 00:21:33.855
Just keep it with you.

00:21:34.438 --> 00:21:36.480
I'll call the police here.

00:21:36.563 --> 00:21:41.438
Use the commotion
to shake off the Kodoku watchers first.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.063
All right!

00:21:43.855 --> 00:21:46.980
Let's get this mission underway.

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:54.980
Come in.

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:00.230
The analysis results came out.

00:22:00.313 --> 00:22:04.396
Just as you suspected,
they're communicating by telegram.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.980
DOMESTIC TELEGRAM RECORD

00:22:07.063 --> 00:22:10.396
Since May 5th, the day of
the reported incident at Tenryuji Temple,

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.480
telegram correspondence
has drastically increased.

00:22:13.563 --> 00:22:15.480
NUMBER OF TELEGRAMS
MAY 5TH: 156

00:22:15.563 --> 00:22:16.646
What else?

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:18.730
We can't figure out the content

00:22:18.813 --> 00:22:21.188
since they're corresponding in code.

00:22:25.438 --> 00:22:26.271
However,

00:22:26.855 --> 00:22:29.188
we did find out
where these telegrams originated.

00:22:30.396 --> 00:22:31.230
Where?

00:22:31.813 --> 00:22:33.355
-Show him the map.
-Yes, sir.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.146
The southern foot of Mount Fuji.

00:22:43.855 --> 00:22:46.896
The map suggests there's nothing there.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.396
MOUNT FUJI
SHIZUOKA TELEGRAPH OFFICE

00:22:49.021 --> 00:22:51.188
The zaibatsu's stronghold.

00:22:52.271 --> 00:22:54.396
Kawaji. Head there immediately.

00:23:04.855 --> 00:23:10.438
"Clash between shizoku
in Yokkaichi City on Tokaido Road…"

00:23:24.563 --> 00:23:25.563
Gentlemen.

00:23:26.521 --> 00:23:27.396
What is it?

00:23:27.896 --> 00:23:29.646
The government is taking action.

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:30.563
What?

00:23:32.813 --> 00:23:34.521
I wouldn't worry about it.

00:23:35.021 --> 00:23:38.021
There is no way they can reach us here.

00:23:39.063 --> 00:23:42.855
We have a guardian angel
on our side, after all.

00:23:46.855 --> 00:23:49.355
Oh, yes. You're right about that.

00:23:50.355 --> 00:23:51.313
Well said.

00:23:57.813 --> 00:24:00.480
Thank you for earlier.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:07.563
How old were you
when you started training, Iroha?

00:24:11.188 --> 00:24:13.688
All of the Kyohachi-ryu
were abandoned as children.

00:24:14.188 --> 00:24:15.855
We don't know our real ages.

00:24:16.438 --> 00:24:19.313
Were there any other girls?

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:21.896
No.

00:24:23.646 --> 00:24:25.188
I was young

00:24:26.605 --> 00:24:28.063
and the weakest of them all.

00:24:28.646 --> 00:24:29.855
You were the weakest?

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:32.688
It was a long time ago.

00:24:46.688 --> 00:24:50.771
What should I do to be as strong as you?

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:01.355
You don't have to…

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:04.355
and there's no need.

00:25:07.188 --> 00:25:09.396
No matter how skilled
you get at using a sword…

00:25:11.855 --> 00:25:13.480
it won't bring you happiness.

00:25:19.563 --> 00:25:20.438
He's here.

00:25:33.105 --> 00:25:35.646
Ow! That hurts.

00:25:36.146 --> 00:25:38.521
No need to be so rough!

00:25:39.313 --> 00:25:40.813
H-Hello, sir.

00:25:41.313 --> 00:25:43.188
He's the suspect for the teahouse murders.

00:25:43.271 --> 00:25:44.230
You've got it wrong.

00:25:44.313 --> 00:25:45.938
We'll hold him in jail.

00:25:46.021 --> 00:25:46.855
Yes, sir.

00:25:46.938 --> 00:25:48.480
-Let's go!
-Ow, ow!

00:25:55.688 --> 00:25:58.021
I can't wait to see what happens.

00:25:59.688 --> 00:26:01.480
-No!
-Silence!

00:26:01.563 --> 00:26:02.605
POLICE BRANCH OFFICE

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.563
You stay quiet in here.
We'll interrogate you later.

00:26:11.646 --> 00:26:12.688
Hey! Wait.

00:26:13.355 --> 00:26:14.813
Please.

00:26:16.021 --> 00:26:17.188
What about a guard?

00:26:19.521 --> 00:26:20.980
Shouldn't you have one?

00:26:21.563 --> 00:26:24.396
What? You're scared of ghosts?

00:26:26.563 --> 00:26:28.146
That's not it.

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:31.021
Hey, wait! Wait!

00:26:31.605 --> 00:26:33.605
Wait! Don't leave me alone!

00:27:09.855 --> 00:27:11.021
Let's go.

00:27:25.938 --> 00:27:26.980
108

00:27:35.563 --> 00:27:38.521
We're from the Police Bureau.
Your chief knows we're coming.

00:27:42.313 --> 00:27:44.063
Seems like they took the bait.

00:27:44.646 --> 00:27:46.438
-Huh?
-What's your name, young man?

00:27:48.146 --> 00:27:49.813
I'm Shinnosuke Sayama.

00:27:49.896 --> 00:27:52.021
Shinnosuke, hold these for me.

00:27:52.105 --> 00:27:53.146
Huh?

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:54.813
Wait!

00:28:00.521 --> 00:28:04.480
The time is 2:17 p.m.
Number 108, Shujiro Saga.

00:28:23.021 --> 00:28:25.521
We're here to examine the suspect
who was just detained.

00:28:25.605 --> 00:28:28.146
Sir, he's in the detention cell
in the basement.

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:29.438
Let me show you the way.

00:28:37.605 --> 00:28:38.646
Hello, sir.

00:28:43.688 --> 00:28:44.688
Hello.

00:28:45.563 --> 00:28:47.563
I'll join them for the examination.

00:28:48.146 --> 00:28:48.980
Yes, sir.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.938
Isn't this place…

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:14.438
At 2:17 p.m. by Kuwana-juku,
number 108, Shujiro Saga was eliminated.

00:32:02.105 --> 00:32:05.730
MITSUI BANK
RECORD OF ALL TRANSACTIONS

00:32:05.813 --> 00:32:07.938
MITSUI BANK

MITSUI BANK GUIDELINES

MITSUI BANK

00:32:19.355 --> 00:32:20.730
This place is…

00:32:29.896 --> 00:32:31.146
MITSUI BANK

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:32.438
A bank.

00:32:42.105 --> 00:32:43.271
That guy…

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.938
Are you here to interrogate me?

00:33:15.146 --> 00:33:16.146
Listen to me.

00:33:17.021 --> 00:33:20.688
I didn't kill anybody.
I can explain everything.

00:33:21.271 --> 00:33:24.063
Some crazy people
ordered us to kill each other.

00:33:24.146 --> 00:33:26.105
They threatened to kill us if we escaped.

00:33:26.188 --> 00:33:28.813
Put me under police protection.

00:33:29.396 --> 00:33:32.396
Please. Keep the Kodoku away from me…

00:33:40.355 --> 00:33:41.730
What's going on?

00:33:41.813 --> 00:33:42.855
Wait! No, wait--

00:34:51.146 --> 00:34:52.771
So 108's body is in here?

00:34:52.855 --> 00:34:53.771
Yes, sir.

00:35:28.688 --> 00:35:31.021
Seems that a rat has slipped inside.

00:35:43.563 --> 00:35:45.396
Who's there?

00:35:49.813 --> 00:35:52.396
I'm Takayama
of the Police Bureau's Fourth Division.

00:35:55.146 --> 00:35:58.396
I don't recall any subordinates
with that name.

00:35:59.355 --> 00:36:02.688
Oh, you're from the Police Bureau too…

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.230
You're not fooling anyone.

00:36:09.146 --> 00:36:10.480
Kyojin Tsuge.

00:36:47.646 --> 00:36:49.813
Do you really think you can escape?

00:36:51.646 --> 00:36:52.605
Come now.

00:36:54.146 --> 00:36:56.021
Don't waste time and show yourself.

00:37:01.188 --> 00:37:02.688
Kokushu Saga.

00:37:17.146 --> 00:37:18.605
Hanjiro Nakamura.

00:37:19.688 --> 00:37:21.521
Please, call me Sakura now.

00:37:22.813 --> 00:37:25.188
I saw how Ando was cut down
at Tenryuji Temple.

00:37:25.688 --> 00:37:27.230
I suspected it was you.

00:37:27.313 --> 00:37:30.188
I've been secretly rooting for you.

00:37:30.271 --> 00:37:32.605
I thought you died that day.

00:37:38.896 --> 00:37:42.938
Life is unpredictable, isn't it?

00:37:46.271 --> 00:37:47.188
I…

00:37:48.563 --> 00:37:50.771
I have always looked up to you.

00:37:52.438 --> 00:37:54.188
Just tell me one thing.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.730
What is it that you are trying to achieve?

00:38:01.188 --> 00:38:03.021
I cannot answer that.

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:10.813
When two old friends reunite,
they either share drinks together…

00:38:13.563 --> 00:38:14.855
or they kill each other.

00:38:18.105 --> 00:38:19.480
It's one or the other.

00:39:31.813 --> 00:39:36.480
Our analysis shows that the location
they were sending the coded telegrams to

00:39:36.563 --> 00:39:38.605
was the Nihonbashi Telegraph Office.

00:39:39.105 --> 00:39:44.355
So we tracked the individual
who picked up the telegrams…

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:47.646
and found out where they went.

00:39:49.646 --> 00:39:50.646
Where?

00:39:51.938 --> 00:39:53.813
The final destination…

00:39:57.105 --> 00:39:59.063
was the Home Ministry's Police Bureau.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.771
Gentlemen.
Apologies for keeping you waiting.

00:40:19.355 --> 00:40:20.980
We've been waiting for you, sir.

00:40:23.146 --> 00:40:25.313
It took you rather long, Organizer.

00:40:25.396 --> 00:40:26.396
Indeed.

00:40:47.313 --> 00:40:48.396
Home Minister.

00:40:49.146 --> 00:40:52.021
I cannot be sure if I should say this…

00:40:56.105 --> 00:40:57.188
What is it?

00:40:59.563 --> 00:41:01.896
Can we really trust Kawaji?

00:41:09.605 --> 00:41:14.271
Once again, I would like to thank you all
for agreeing to this game.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.730
It's all for the good of this country.

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:21.521
If it's money you need, don't hesitate.

00:41:21.605 --> 00:41:23.146
Thank you very much.

00:41:26.813 --> 00:41:30.396
Eradicating the specters
is a huge project for our nation.

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:33.313
A great cause
that we cannot afford to fail.

00:41:35.188 --> 00:41:40.105
Let us be the ones
to fulfill this duty, shall we?

00:41:57.813 --> 00:42:01.063
For the future of this country.

00:42:21.688 --> 00:42:26.688
70 REMAINING

00:46:21.521 --> 00:46:25.021
