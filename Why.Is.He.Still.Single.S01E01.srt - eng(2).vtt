(Actually, my name wasn't Yu Yu.)

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.230
(But I changed my name)

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.580
(for perfect symmetry.)

I changed my name was...)

(My mom wanted me to live a long life,)

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.230
(so she gave me
a super old-fashioned name.)

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.270
(that a decent life)

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.700
(should start
from details like one's name.)

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.070
(Therefore, a lot of people
think I'm pretentious.)

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.070
(But maybe they're all wrong.)

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.110
Hello?

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.420
Dad.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.020
Got it.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.830
I'm watching a movie right now.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.230
Can I go after the movie?

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.390
Got it.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.740
Okay, that's all. Bye.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.670
Are you in the wrong seat?

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.180
Sorry about that.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.950
Can I switch seats with you?

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.880
Why?

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:12.790
I have this habit.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.240
I sit in that seat
every time I come to this hall.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.620
But somehow,

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.990
you ended up buying it today.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.420
I calculated it carefully.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.940
The seat you're in right now

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.030
is exactly
where the hall's acoustics converge.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.230
And the distance to the screen

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.940
also offers the best view.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.110
You'll get
the best audiovisual experience.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.110
If you don't care about that...

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.060
Why didn't you

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.590
just sit here from the start?

00:04:45.462 --> 00:04:47.151
Isn't the whole point of picking seats

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.860
so you sit where you choose?

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.350
You can't just sit anywhere.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.910
I think you have a point.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.470
Let's sit in the seats we bought then.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.390
Hello?

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.990
It's the weekend.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.550
Mr. Yu, we have a problem.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.550
We can't paint more green, Mr. Sun.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.500
If you keep painting,

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.110
Mr. Yu will kill me.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.380
Hey, you...

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.820
Just stay within this area.

00:05:29.884 --> 00:05:30.928
Stop painting over there.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.230
Mr. Yu, I couldn't stop him.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.940
Sun, what's going on?

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.110
The work order,
design plan, materials list,

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.940
and the blueprint say deep scarlet.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.417
Why are you painting it green?

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.590
The homeowner wants green.

00:05:42.662 --> 00:05:44.906
The homeowner wants green,
so you paint green?

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.550
What else would I do?

00:05:47.595 --> 00:05:49.884
You listen to the homeowner
or the blueprint? Huh?

00:05:49.928 --> 00:05:50.670
You tell me.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.260
Put that down.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.620
You want to fight?

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.300
- Miss, you're here.
- Hello.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.884
I was nearby

00:05:57.884 --> 00:05:59.260
and thought I'd take a look.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.500
Well, well, the designer is here.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.620
Looks good.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:08.740
This wall can't be green.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.060
It's fine.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.150
I told them to change it.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.260
You can't change it.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.062
I designed deep scarlet for you.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.060
Elegant and dignified,

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.710
perfect for your elegance.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.500
In ancient Europe,

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.110
this color was adored by nobles.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.420
Look at the render.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.710
If you switch it to green,

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.060
the whole effect changes.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.180
And if you change other colors
to match the green,

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.740
the cost goes up too.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.110
Leave everything else the same.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.820
Just paint this wall green.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.260
If you do that,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.670
the whole color balance

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.180
will look totally off.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.420
Living in a space like that

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.940
will affect your personality.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.820
You'll get irritable,
anxious, and depressed.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:57.990
Don't scare me!

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.350
Listen.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.230
I lack green in my fate.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.740
I like green.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.470
No, the green you mean

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.310
isn't this green.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.230
This is emerald green...

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.230
Enough!

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.500
Let me tell you.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.740
I make the decisions here.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.740
Anyone who changes the color

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.470
will be swapped.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.860
Hello, Ms. Lin?

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.940

Oh, change it to scallion-green then.

Get lost.

No need, thanks.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.020

Mr. Yu,

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:29.380
as a professional designer,

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.860
you never have the right
to criticize a client's taste.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.140
It's been so many years.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.230
Why are you still making
such rookie mistakes?

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.710
You should tell the client your concept.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.430
Explain how you combine practicality

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:41.260
with your design philosophy.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:42.990
I just couldn't hold it in.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.595
Besides, that's not
why I didn't want to go

00:08:45.595 --> 00:08:46.710

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.110

00:09:41.462 --> 00:09:43.351
It's a promotional seminar
full of newcomers.

00:09:43.351 --> 00:09:45.130
Why do I need to be here?
I'm not a newcomer.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.590
If clients don't like these newcomers,

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.310
who do you think they'll notice instead?

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:50.870
- Me.
- Exactly.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.470
You're here to hold down the fort.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.950
These seven newcomers
are all counting on you.

00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:57.190
I'm not the old man
in Calabash Brothers.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:58.540
You can be Snow White if you want.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.140
Remember. I'm here to promote you.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:02.500
No need to thank me.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.190
Just cooperate.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.460
Cheer up.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:06.950
You're sulking

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.860
like someone owes you money.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.110
Mr. Yu, Ms. Lin.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.260
You're here.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.900
The presentation slides are ready.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.780
Here, keep an eye on Mr. Yu.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.740
Don't let him run off.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.830
Watch him for me. Watch closely.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:21.310
Okay.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:30.190
Wait, Mr. Yu.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.620
Why did you use a black-and-white photo
for this poster?

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:35.306
Because I'll look stunning

00:10:35.351 --> 00:10:36.660
when my colored face appears.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.590
It's color psychology. Got it?

00:10:40.817 --> 00:10:41.990
No wonder you're the master

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.990
and I'm the disciple.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:47.350
- Wu.
- Yeah?

00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:50.728
Want to switch roles and be the master?

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:55.660
Next,

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:56.870
let's welcome

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.660
Yichu Decoration Group's

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.990
most senior designer,

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:02.230
Yu Yu.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.820
(Yu Yu Design Studio)

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.660
Distinguished guests,

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:21.780
good evening.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.780
I'm an architectural designer.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.430
(Home is a social invention.)

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.470
(It doesn't just turn)

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.500
(biological humans into social humans.)

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.900
(Home is the only place
where flaws and failures can hide.)

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.310
(It holds sweetness and love.)

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.540
(It's also the only place in modern life
where fire can be lit.)

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.900
(Only then does home
have warmth and character.)

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.070
(When a family sits together
for a meal,)

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.470
(that's when home feels the best.)

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.620
(So my designs all revolve around this.)

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.380
(I call this the warm zone.)

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.860
(Human warmth.)

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.260
My interior designs begin with the home.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.310
A place that only lets you sleep
isn't a home.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.540
For example, a hotel.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.470
Want a bowl?

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.340
What kind of noodles?

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.540
Authentic Tianjin noodles with gravy.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:40.380
Authentic?

00:12:41.617 --> 00:12:42.990
This isn't hand-pulled noodles.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.470
And the sauce is way too clear.

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:45.900
The toppings are pathetic.

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:47.990
There are so many. How is this pathetic?

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:49.220
There are like

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:50.830
four or five.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:52.190
Is four or five a lot?

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.620
In Tianjin,
that barely fills a side platter.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:57.380
And there's no red sheet.

00:12:57.462 --> 00:12:58.500
How can it share in my joy?

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.380
I didn't expect you
to know noodles this well.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.950
I went to university in Tianjin.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:04.800
Of course I know.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.710
And this isn't knowledge.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.310
It's taste.
What you eat isn't the point.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:10.990
But you must be particular.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:12.150
Never settle.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.310
You're Mr. Yu, right?

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.780
What you did earlier was so cool.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.070
Your warm zone totally proved

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.617
your "no settling with food" philosophy.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.710
I love it.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.950
Oh?

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.070
You love food too?

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:28.030
Yeah.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:29.260
For example,

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.500
this Tianjin noodles with gravy.

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:33.830
If I could eat an authentic bowl of it

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.380
in your warm zone,

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:38.350
that would be bliss.

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:40.380
No need to go to my house. Wait here.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:46.700
(Tianjin Noodles With Gravy)

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:23.070
He said eating red sheet

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:24.500
could help me share some of your joy.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:25.500
Miss.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.780
It's freezing and you're telling jokes.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.110
Your hair's literally blowing up.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:30.350
It's true.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.660
I even flew to Los Angeles
just to eat curry last week.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:34.860
Huh?

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:36.780
A spontaneous trip?

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.310
But shouldn't you go to India for curry?

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.110
You've screwed me over today.

00:14:44.173 --> 00:14:45.660
- Here.
- Why are you giving me this?

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:46.740
No. Hey.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:53.990
Did you just throw up?

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.540
(Wildebeest Space)

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.230
Isn't Wildebeest Space...

00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:13.620
just a store that rents Blu-rays
and sells second-hand copies?

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:16.430
I sell sentimentality.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.020
Everything here was pre-loved.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.990
I'm the relay baton of love,

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.740
passing it
to the next person who'll love it.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:24.950
Any problem with that?

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:27.260
How sentimental.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:31.140
My name's Huaiqing.
Of course I have sentiment.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.430
Right now it's not about the noodles.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.540
It's about skill.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:39.030
Skill for what?

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:40.470
I'm trying to show her

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:43.070
what an authentic Tianjin noodle
really is.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.660
You really are something.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.260
You always manage to annoy a woman
within ten sentences.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:53.070
Hmph.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:53.910
Hmph what?

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.620
Not convinced? Let's bet.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:56.500
Bet on what?

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.751
Whatever it is, you'll lose.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:59.620
- Li.
- Hey, Andi.

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:01.830
Call me Huaiqing.

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.310
Alright, Li. Any new releases lately?

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:05.430
The whole second row is new.

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:06.351
Pick whatever you like.

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:11.070
Hey, Andi, let me introduce you.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.500
This is the famous designer,

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:14.660
Mr. Yu Yu.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.310
This is Andi, my good friend.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:19.900
Hello, Mr. Yu Yu.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:20.740
Yeah.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:28.430
You're doomed to lose.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:32.700
Hello.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:34.900
Oh, hello.

00:16:34.928 --> 00:16:36.540
Have you tried
noodles with gravy before?

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:38.270
Ah...

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.350
Yes.

00:16:39.351 --> 00:16:41.310
Compared to curry rice,
which tastes better?

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:44.260
Can these two be compared?

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:45.860
If you had to choose one,

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:47.190
which would it be?

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:49.750
Curry.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:50.620
Mm.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:53.900
What do you think of me?

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.230
Pretty good.

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:05.590
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:06.550
Andi.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:07.570
Hey!

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:08.580
Why are you leaving?

00:17:08.595 --> 00:17:10.062
Hey, she said I'm pretty good.

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:12.230
Pretty good?

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:15.950
Why did she come?

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:17.470
To rent discs.

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:18.820
Why did she leave?

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:22.430
You only said five sentences.

00:17:22.462 --> 00:17:25.310
And you've already
seriously affected my business. Pal.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.617
This round doesn't count.

00:17:26.662 --> 00:17:27.390
I wasn't ready.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.740
Do you have a loyalty card?

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.830
No.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:43.540
That'll be 98.40 yuan in total.

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:44.790
How much is this?

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:45.790
1.60 yuan.

00:17:47.017 --> 00:17:49.730
You get a lottery draw if you spend
more than 100 yuan. Want to try?

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:50.660
Sure.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.180
(Happy Shopping, Lucky to Have You,
Scratch Area, First Prize)

Congratulations, you won first prize.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:06.670
How big is the prize?

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.550
Huh?

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.430
I'm taking a taxi.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.060
You really are something.

You always manage to annoy a woman
within ten sentences.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.340
Hey, how much is this?

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.395
Tell me. How big is the prize?
I'm taking a taxi.

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:32.430
How much for the gum?

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.030
12.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:35.340
- Can it blow bubbles?
- No.

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:36.270
Why?

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.260
Because it's not bubble gum.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.470
Do you have bubble gum?

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:43.790
Are you buying it?

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:44.820
Do you dislike me?

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.540
Juan, did the cheese
I ordered last time arrive?

00:19:08.573 --> 00:19:10.817
- It did. Okay.
- Could you grab it for me? Thanks.

all the men I meet are problematic?

I even met a man

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.300
at dinner yesterday.

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:45.728
Six years old. Want to meet him?

00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:46.390
I'm telling you.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.780
I have nothing to do with you
from today on.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.470
What? No one's cooking for you,

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:52.820
and you missed me?

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.580
Eat?

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.580
Get jealous.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:19:59.620
Hey.

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:01.630
Qing.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:04.540
No, I just argued with him.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.340
I stormed out in anger.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:07.950
I know.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:10.500
Hearing that alone is enough.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.580
My uncle always has a spare room.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.595
He lets me stay there.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.150
(Riverside Building)
I think I'm almost there.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:26.020
I feel like
I've time-traveled to the Republic era.

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:29.580
Alright, I'll stop talking to you.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:30.910
I'm entering the elevator.

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:38.230
Ah.

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:51.420
Xia Xiaoman.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:54.510
It loves you.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.740
Oh, thanks.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.470
Why are you following me?

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:56.390
Are you moving in here?

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.540
Oh, we're neighbors now.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:02.710
When will you move out?

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.020
Soon, I guess. Why?

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:07.030
This wall is bad.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:18.060
Xia Xiaoman, I love you.

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:19.910
I love you so much.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.910
I love you extremely, extremely much.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:27.060
Xia Xiaoman.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.150
Can you be quiet?

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:34.380
Great.

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:54.470
Dao, look at our place.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:02.780
Wow, the kitchen.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:04.740
Our room.

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:20.260
Wow, Dao, look. Isn't it beautiful?

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.100
Dao.

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:56.780
Dao, you didn't help me when I fell.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.180
Okay.

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:00.870
Got it.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.060
Yes, thanks.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.300
Dao.

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:15.360
Alright.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:16.870
I know you love me.

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:19.780
Dao.

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.100
Dao.

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.540
Alright.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.700
(Inspiration)

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:38.630
This is way too noisy.

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:40.030
Dao.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:53.300
Hey.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.630
It's too noisy.

00:25:01.551 --> 00:25:02.630
You want me to be quiet?

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:03.710
Why aren't you quiet then?

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:27.670
Can you be quiet?

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:48.060
What's wrong with you?

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:49.580
It hurts...

00:25:53.862 --> 00:25:55.595
(Emergency)
This seems like a hemorrhoid flare-up.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.150
Do you need pain relief now?

00:25:58.262 --> 00:25:59.740
Which hospital do you want to go to?

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.190
Zhongjing Private Hospital.

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:03.420
Alright.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:05.390
Hold your husband steady.

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:06.470
Hey, he...

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:07.470
He's not my husband.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:10.860
Oh.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.100
What? Strangulated hernia?

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:25.950
It's been five hours since the onset.

00:26:25.973 --> 00:26:27.300
It can cause intestinal necrosis.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.300
It's life-threatening.

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:29.780
We need surgery immediately.

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:36.710
Fortunately, it hasn't strangulated yet.

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:38.950
Dr. Gu is trying manual reduction.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.910
What? Manual reduction?

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:42.430
It's been so long since the onset.

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:43.470
It's difficult.

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.430
But the advantage
is that no surgery is required.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.260
It can recover quickly,
reducing patient pain.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:51.710
Yeah, surgery pain is still pain.

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:54.340
Dr. Gu always considers
the patient's perspective.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.990
How are you? Feeling better?

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.830
Much better.

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:25.420
Dr. Gu.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:26.710
The surgery room is ready.

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:27.862
You can go in for surgery.

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.300
No need.
I've reduced the bowel into the abdomen.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.300
Give the patient
a CT scan of his abdomen.

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.790
Then the patient can return to the ward.

00:27:33.795 --> 00:27:34.440
Yeah.

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:35.380
Okay.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:37.310
Monitor closely.

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:41.710
Ah...

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.420
Name?

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:57.590
- Yu Yu.
- Age?

00:27:57.850 --> 00:27:59.020
2 days until I'm 40.

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:06.470
Doctor, he said he wants
Zhong Liangchuan to examine him.

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.350
The vice director
went for an urgent consult.

00:28:08.351 --> 00:28:09.000
Ah?

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.190
Family, please wait outside.

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:11.910
I'm not family.

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:14.860
Hello?

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:17.500
Have you taken painkillers?

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:18.530
No.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:19.810
Do you have high blood pressure,

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:21.150
- diabetes or heart disease?
- None.

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:22.519
- Allergies?
- None.

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.490
Family medical history?

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.340
None.

00:28:24.373 --> 00:28:25.380
Prepare for a rectal exam.

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:26.870
Ah? Rectal exam?

00:28:26.906 --> 00:28:28.580
I'll perform an anoscopy to examine you.

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:29.820
I'm asking why a rectal exam.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.470
Because 120 ER
shows you have acute hemorrhoids.

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:35.150
They're my interns.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.340
Pull down his pants.

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.390
- Hey, you...
- No!

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:40.740
Hey.

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.430
Hey, you can't leave.

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:48.150
I'm not in pain anymore.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:50.340
Go on then.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.910
Ah.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:58.820
How about this?

00:28:59.306 --> 00:29:01.260
Today we'll use
hemorrhoid suppositories first.

00:29:01.328 --> 00:29:02.870
I'll also prescribe some oral ibuprofen.

00:29:02.995 --> 00:29:04.580
You'll stay overnight for observation.

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:06.430
Tomorrow morning,
we'll reassess your condition

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:08.300
and plan further treatment. Okay?

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.260
If you insist I stay,

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:15.900
it's not impossible.

00:29:18.217 --> 00:29:19.795
Come on. Let's fill the prescription.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:21.795
You've just said
your 13th sentence to me.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.140
So?

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.910
Do you dislike me?

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.430
No.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:29.340
You're a good doctor.

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:35.390
Thanks. You be a good patient too, okay?

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:39.020
How is Dr. Gu so amazing?

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.060
She can handle any kind of patient.

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:42.740
What are you saying?

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:43.740
You're mumbling.

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:45.670
Song, Ping Yang.

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:46.440
- Yeah.
- Here.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.560
Take him to fill his prescription.

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.390
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.500
I'll help you.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.340
Don't touch me.

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:52.950
I can walk myself.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:54.780
Over there.

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:00.950
What?

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:03.260
I'm just doing a good deed.

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:05.260
So what if I just moved here?

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:07.500
I can't ignore someone who's sick.

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:11.550
Hello.

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:14.390
The man admitted earlier
needs overnight observation.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.820
Are you staying with him?

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:16.790
A man?

00:30:16.884 --> 00:30:18.500
The one you sent to hospital is a man?

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.500
He's a middle-aged man.

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:22.630
He's my neighbor.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:23.740
Believe it or not.

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:28.040
Sorry. Did I say something wrong?

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.060
No, it's fine. You don't have to
worry about my boyfriend.

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:30.990
He's always jealous.

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:34.190
How is my neighbor?

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:35.230
He's got hemorrhoids.

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:36.430
I've given him medication.

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:37.630
We need to see if it works.

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:39.670
If not, surgery might be considered.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.630
But no major issues for now.

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:45.870
Can I leave then?

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:47.500
Technically, yes.

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:48.710
Okay, thanks.

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.140
Bye.

00:30:54.817 --> 00:30:56.351
The patient was admitted overnight.

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:58.862
He's given topical treatment
like pain relief and antibiotics,

00:30:58.928 --> 00:31:00.470
and hemorrhoid suppositories.

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:01.910
Symptoms eased overnight.

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:03.106
He can sleep intermittently.

00:31:03.106 --> 00:31:05.573
This morning,
anal pain eased, no bleeding.

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:06.710
Okay.

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:09.540
This patient has a typical
external hemorrhoid history.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:10.950
Schedule a colonoscopy.

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:13.230
Regular checkups
are necessary at this age.

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:14.100
Okay.

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:16.060
Alright, you can all leave now.

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:25.310
Hey, Yu.

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.430
Still in pain? Feeling better?

00:31:27.595 --> 00:31:29.100
You did a great job acting as director.

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.020
(Zhong Liangchuan, Vice Director)
Vice director.

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:34.470
Here's your 5,000 yuan back.

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:36.340
Transfer it to me.

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.100
Transfers leave a trace.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.260
My wife would find out.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.500
Besides, don't you like cash?

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:46.540
Can you lend me 10,000 yuan more?

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:47.510
No.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.390
Dad.

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:52.900
Uncle.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.120
Yu.

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:55.150
How are you?

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:56.260
Oh, I'm fine.

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:59.020
Why did you bring flowers?
They'll be thrown away anyway.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:31:59.950
You're overthinking.

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:01.630
I bought them for myself.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.430
I hate the smell of bachelors.

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:05.340
Bachelor.

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:07.470
Mom.

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:10.030
Here, eat quickly.

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.910
Why eat a red egg?

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.020
I'm not in confinement.

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:16.390
Today is the seventh day.

00:32:16.484 --> 00:32:18.230
Eating red eggs
brings good luck in love.

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:19.430
I won't eat.

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:20.550
You must eat.

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:22.900
Later.

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:26.100
Uncle, what illness do you have?

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:28.870
A secret.

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:31.100
Why be shy about it?

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:33.190
Stop nagging.

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:34.950
Where were you
messing around last night?

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:36.240
I couldn't find you anywhere.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:37.940
Messing around?

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.300
Messing around?

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.230
I had a consultation last night.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:44.740
Yu, don't speak recklessly.

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:46.100
I'm telling you guys.

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.780
Don't collude to trick me.

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:49.580
I never collude with anyone.

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:54.390
If your brother were colluding,
would he still dislike women?

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.100
Mom, why would I dislike women?

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:58.540
Then show me who you like.

00:32:58.540 --> 00:32:59.630
Bring her here.

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:00.910
What are you here for?

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:02.780
To push you to get married.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.300
(Lin Sa)

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:08.420
Hello?

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:10.390
You said you'd go to the site today.

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:11.230
Where are you?

00:33:12.462 --> 00:33:13.580
- I'm sick.
- A woman.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:14.750
Stop faking it.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:16.670
Woman?

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:17.910
Go to the site immediately.

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:19.190
Hello?

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:24.100
Who's this woman?

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:26.390
No one.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:27.870
Then why is she...

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:28.990
Okay, Mom, stop talking.

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:29.910
I'm going to work.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:37.630
Hey, where are you going?

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:38.610
To work.

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:39.630
You can't leave.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:40.710
You still have tests pending.

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:41.750
I'm fine now.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:43.260
That's just the medicine working.

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:45.260
If you don't complete treatment,
it will recur.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:46.820
The recurrence
could be worse than before.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:47.660
Aren't you tired?

00:33:47.684 --> 00:33:48.549
Huh?

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:49.880
You just finished a night shift.

00:33:49.884 --> 00:33:51.040
You should go back and sleep.

00:33:51.795 --> 00:33:53.260
You need to take care of your health.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:54.580
Don't think you're still young.

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:55.884
You're not that young anymore.

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:58.820
When you answer calls,
you don't say "hello"

00:33:58.820 --> 00:33:59.740
or "hi", right?

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:00.820
You just say "hey".

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.270
Huh?

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.300
If that's the case,

00:34:03.395 --> 00:34:05.195
you're also not that young anymore.

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:13.710
Hey.

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:14.790
Hey, Jia.

00:34:15.106 --> 00:34:17.084
Last time I asked you
to go on a blind date.

00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:18.390
You stood me up again.

00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:19.830
Meet him today.

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:20.670
Okay.

00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:24.790
Do you like babies?

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.390
Our baby.

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:32.470
I do like kids.

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.500
Great, I like them too.

00:34:36.084 --> 00:34:37.350
Now that the policy is relaxed,

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.310
I think we should have at least two.

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:41.660
No, the more, the better.

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:44.140
And I'm the type of person

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:46.990
who doesn't hold traditional
son-preference views.

00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:49.060
But I think

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:52.790
we should first discuss inheritance.

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:56.620
No.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:57.460
Hey.

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.950
It'll be fine
after meeting a few more times.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.220
(Noodles From the Dingmao Year)
Jia.

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.100
(Bus 220, Yanji East Road Terminal)
Did you go on that blind date?

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:20.950
I did.

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:22.700
- How was it?
- Not bad.

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:24.270
Tall and handsome.

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:25.160
Successful in career.

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:26.030
Not for me.

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:26.980
Huh?

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:28.750
Dad, my standards aren't high.

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:30.700
Just easy on the eyes,

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:31.790
share interests,

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:33.020
and have things to talk about.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.020
I'm busy.

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:35.060
I have work today.

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:35.950
Can you...

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:39.580
Fine.

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:40.580
But I remind you,

00:35:40.595 --> 00:35:42.500
you have one more
blind date slot this month.

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:46.950
Your scallion oil noodles.

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:48.084
Half a portion of spicy pork.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.090
Thanks.

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:51.500
Why are you back so late tonight?

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:52.870
Actually, not too late.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:54.500
I already had a meal earlier,

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:55.700
but I couldn't finish it.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.350
Your noodles are still the best.

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:18.580
What a big balcony.

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:21.020
The view isn't bad either.

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:25.310
Has that uncle been divorced twice?

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.580
Yeah, he just got divorced recently,

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:29.790
so he went traveling.

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:31.310
That's why this place became available.

00:36:32.106 --> 00:36:34.870
You should've said so. Tell me
next time he marries for the third time.

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:37.540
Alright.

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:40.470
Stop getting upset
over that jerk.

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:42.230
I'm telling you.

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:43.390
He doesn't love you.

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:45.217
Otherwise,
he'd have come to cheer you up.

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:47.830
He's acting like this
just to force you to break up with him.

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:51.790
No, he said he really loves me before

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:52.990
and even wanted to marry me.

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:54.950
He probably says that
to every girlfriend.

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:56.620
Anyway,

00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:00.180
you can't just settle for anyone
just to get married.

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:01.580
You have to choose a good one.

00:37:03.795 --> 00:37:06.506
What about the neighbor
you took to the hospital last time?

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.180
He's just a weird older guy.

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:10.660
Ten years later,

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:13.220
he won't be handsome, just weird.

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:20.790
Who's coming? Go help open the door.

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.430
Coming.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:26.830
Who's there?

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:32.020
Wait for me.

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:33.484
Open the door when I come out.

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:38.180
Oh, hello.

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:39.180
I'm Shen Wu.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.990
I'm your neighbor, Mr. Yu's assistant.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:42.310
Just call me Wu.

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:43.160
Hello.

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.430
One of these is a gift from Mr. Yu.

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:47.395
The other is the medical fee
you helped pay first.

00:37:47.395 --> 00:37:49.120
Thanks for taking Mr. Yu
to the hospital.

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.180
How kind.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.390
(Movie Voucher)
Two tickets

00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:58.430
and one lollipop?

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:00.060
Too little?

00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:03.540
No, it's the thought that counts.

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:05.350
This gift is significant.

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:07.390
This is my gift to you.

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:12.350
Why are you giving me a gift?

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:14.180
He's my superior after all.

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:15.870
I'd be jobless
if anything happens to him.

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:18.380
Speaking of,

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:20.270
add me on WeChat.

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:21.660
If anything happens to Mr. Yu,

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:23.270
you can just contact me directly.

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:27.110
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:28.470
Thanks, appreciate it.

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:29.310
No problem.

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.430
Open the door. I'm ready.

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.830
Why did you put on full makeup?

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:37.950
He's quite handsome.

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:39.220
He's gone.

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:41.270
He's gone?
Why didn't you ask him to stay?

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:08.260
- Sun.
- Yes?

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:09.750
The lines aren't aligned.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:15.470
Ah, don't be so fussy.

00:39:15.706 --> 00:39:16.790
Where is it not aligned?

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.470
Check yourself if it's aligned.

00:39:23.706 --> 00:39:24.790
What are you looking at?

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:26.217
Do what you're supposed to do.

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:32.020
Hey, I told you to come see.

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:32.860
No.

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:35.310
Tear it up and redo it.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:39.870
Why?

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:41.262
Because your work is substandard.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:44.220
The client didn't say anything.

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:45.540
Why so fussy?

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.390
Fussy?

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:47.310
There are standards.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:48.230
What standards?

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:49.830
I'm a proper Hui craftsman.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.710
13 generations in my family
have built houses.

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.500
My great-grandfather
built an emperor's tomb.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:55.430
What about yours?

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:57.500
Alright. What does your ancestor
have to do with this?

00:39:57.506 --> 00:39:58.730
Are you tearing it down or not?

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:03.700
No.

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:05.660
No? Fine, I'll tear it.

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:07.150
Hey!

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:09.310
What are you doing?

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:10.700
I call the shots here.

00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:11.830
I decide the effect.

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:12.700
Give me.

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:13.620
I just got to the site.

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.830
Okay.

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:17.310
I'll go shopping with you
after work, okay?

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:19.580
Stop being so fussy. What are you doing?

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.284
Mr. Yu and the foreman
are fighting again.

00:40:21.306 --> 00:40:22.100
Hey, let go.

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.060
What are you doing?

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:24.099
Tear it down or not?

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.660
This is the fifth time this month.

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:26.860
Are you tearing it down or not?

00:40:26.862 --> 00:40:28.350
You're way too fussy.

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:30.310
Win or lose?

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:36.870
I can't tell who's winning right now.

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.140
What are you doing?

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:40.590
Are you tearing it down or not?

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:42.540
Gosh.

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:43.540
Are you okay, Mr. Sun?

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:44.500
I'm telling you.

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:46.540
Mr. Yu won today.

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:47.870
Ah, my leg.

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.060
Ah, my leg.

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:50.470
I can't feel my leg.

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:51.390
Ah.

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:52.862
Look at how you're pretending...

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:53.750
Ah!

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:55.110
Ah!

00:40:57.795 --> 00:40:59.020
Look at how you're pretending.

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.528
I'll hang up first. Talk to you later.

00:41:00.528 --> 00:41:01.910
I didn't even hit you in the butt.

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:02.950
Mr. Yu, are you okay?

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:05.910
Don't touch my butt.

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:14.380

(Interior Design
Architecture Award 2015)

00:41:39.506 --> 00:41:40.617
You haven't fought enough?

00:41:44.995 --> 00:41:46.906
Is there seriously
something wrong with you?

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:48.700
You're even fighting with Sun.

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:50.060
Is something really wrong with you?

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:50.990
Have I ever lied?

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:52.230
Never.

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:54.500
It's because you're so blunt

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:56.180
that things went wrong.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:57.350
I mean...

00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:00.660
Why be embarrassed to tell me
that you're sick?

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:02.700
If you find it embarrassing to say,

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:04.950
you could have told me more tactfully.

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:06.140
Tactfully? How?

00:42:06.417 --> 00:42:07.950
Tell you I have a problem down there?

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:09.750
I'm telling you,

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:11.990
sitting for long periods
can cause a relapse.

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:15.270
So you need to get up
and walk around once in a while.

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:18.350
Oh, does it hurt? Want me to massage it?

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:19.310
I'm back.

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:20.900
Mr. Yu,

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:23.270
reimburse the money
I spent on your neighbor.

00:42:25.106 --> 00:42:26.660
Didn't I already give you the gift?

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:28.220
Why buy her more?

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.220
How dare you mention it?

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:31.310
Ms. Lin.

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:33.270
When I took out those movie tickets

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:34.620
and the lollipop,

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.750
the girl's face was full of contempt.

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:39.540
You're a famous designer.

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:40.700
Why are you so stingy?

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:42.540
Yeah, I felt embarrassed.

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:44.350
I spent money and bought her something.

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:45.620
You don't understand.

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:47.020
It's a first prize.

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:49.180
I gave her my good luck, okay?

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.119
