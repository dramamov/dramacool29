00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.600
Uncle

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.360
What happened here?

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.639
Whose children are you?

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.759
I'm Kangkang.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.839
This is my younger brother, An'an.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.000
We live in Yunshui County.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.240
Please, help me.

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:41.520
Get up first.

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:42.520
I'll take you home.

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:46.440
Come, follow me.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.440
Brother, we're finally home.

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:55.559
Don't worry, An'an.

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:57.399
No one will ever bully us again.

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.479
Mom, will Dad and you forget me?

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:01.320
Of course not.

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:02.520
Mom must have already made

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.839
your favorite osmanthus cake.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.919
It's waiting for you at home.

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.839
Let's go.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.519
This isn't real.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.559
He's pretending.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.760
He's just playing with us.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.480
No.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.839
He's just playing with us.

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:28.839
Can anyone save him?

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.239
He's not breathing.

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:35.200
What should we do?

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.839
What do we do?

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.399
He's not breathing.

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:44.160
What do we do?

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.679
Can anyone save him?

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.799
He's not breathing.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.760
No breath.

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:23.799
An'an.

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:26.920
I'm sorry.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.399
Well?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.880
Did you see the dream clearly?

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.279
It felt so real.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.040
The main character in the dream

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:38.640
is this boy, Akang?

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.320
What do you think Akang's wish is?

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.440
Akang and An'an

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.640
were both kidnapped by that strange man.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.279
They probably died because of it.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.239
But with such a vague dream,

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:52.440
how can we find anyone?

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.239
Let alone

00:05:53.359 --> 00:05:54.480
fulfill his wish for him.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.640
The Seven Stars Lamp only catches nearby dreams.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.679
So the person can't be far from us.

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:02.799
Let's go to Yunshui County first.

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:07.119
Aqi said

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:10.160
we only capture the dreams of the dying.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.559
They're the last obsessions of their lives.

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:14.359
What you need to do

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.679
is to help them

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:16.920
fulfill their wishes.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.200
And collect that thing, what's it called?

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.239
Spirit Aura.

00:06:20.359 --> 00:06:20.839
Right.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.720
Spirit Aura.

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:23.440
If we need to collect it,

00:06:23.799 --> 00:06:25.760
why not catch more dreams?

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:27.119
After all, these days

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:28.920
there are more dead than living.

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:31.320
It's not that easy.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.720
Everyone has wishes,

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:35.959
but only some become dreams

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.640
that we can capture.

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:39.760
They must be extremely strong.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.119
That's true.

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:43.920
But even if we collect them,

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.119
we might not

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:46.399
be able to fulfill them.

00:06:46.679 --> 00:06:48.160
Last time, Liu Chunru's dream

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.440
was so bizarre and supernatural.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.359
And this time, Akang's

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.799
is just as unclear.

00:06:53.359 --> 00:06:54.440
The dying

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.160
must have a confused mind.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.480
Their dreams

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.519
are bound to be unclear.

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:01.279
Sweet dreams,

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:02.239
nightmares,

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:03.959
strange and fantastic,

00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:05.519
real and unreal,

00:07:05.799 --> 00:07:07.640
we must unravel them

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:09.440
to learn what the dead

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.559
truly wished for

00:07:10.559 --> 00:07:11.519
in reality.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.239
We must solve the case first

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.320
before we can resolve their wish.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.359
It's really not easy.

00:07:16.359 --> 00:07:18.559
He Fuyi is a master at solving cases.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.399
True,

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:21.519
but not so good at emotions.

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:25.359
By the way,

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:27.239
how was this dream

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.119
actually collected?

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.920
Don't ask about things you shouldn't.

00:07:32.239 --> 00:07:32.839
Alright.

00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:44.040
Looks like Young Master Wu follows He Fuyi

00:07:44.359 --> 00:07:46.079
just for the Seven Stars Lamp.

00:07:46.359 --> 00:07:47.640
So the master's order is

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.799
to keep watching He Fuyi and Young Master Wu.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.760
If we really find the Seven Stars Lamp,

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.000
even if we destroy it,

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:58.480
we must never let the Empress Dowager get it.

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:00.880
Prince, please calm down.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.200
Is this about An'an?

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.920
This is Jiangnan,

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.160
a land of wealth and riches,

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.519
a place of comfort and luxury.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.079
You're just a minor county magistrate,

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:09.480
yet you live so well,

00:08:09.519 --> 00:08:11.519
better than the governor of a poor region.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.799
You have plenty of people and money.

00:08:13.799 --> 00:08:15.200
So many children have gone missing in half a year.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.160
Do you want to lose your head?

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.160
Prince, please judge fairly.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.920
I will definitely increase efforts.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.040
I will increase efforts.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.559
Now you're scared.

00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:24.160
Get up quickly.

00:08:24.359 --> 00:08:24.799
Continue.

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:26.359
Yes.

00:08:28.799 --> 00:08:29.399
Prince.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.000
The eunuch you mentioned,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.119
I know

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.280
who he is.

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:38.359
He's called Blood Yan Luo.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Rumor has it

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.679
he's a ruthless killer,

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.000
a notorious villain.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.919
The missing children case isn't solved yet,

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.960
and now Blood Yan Luo shows up.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.400
In your jurisdiction,

00:08:52.039 --> 00:08:53.799
strange things happen a lot.

00:08:54.239 --> 00:08:55.719
Prince, I'm being wronged!

00:08:56.159 --> 00:08:57.000
That man

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.599
died twenty years ago.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.840
Dead.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.520
It was twenty years ago.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.760
Are you sure we're talking about the same person?

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:04.880
I'm sure.

00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:06.960
I have written records.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.840
How did he die back then?

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.880
Back then, he...

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.599
His death, it was...

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.880
Really strange.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.039
He just suddenly appeared

00:09:26.039 --> 00:09:27.960
at that abandoned place in our county,

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.239
in front of the Asura Temple.

00:09:29.599 --> 00:09:30.479
When he died,

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.440
even his heart was ripped out.

00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:35.880
Speaking of which,

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.599
this temple

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.000
is also kind of eerie.

00:09:38.919 --> 00:09:40.719
It used to worship

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:41.960
the Asura.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.000
The locals say

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.840
it was the Asura

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.840
who killed Blood Yan Luo.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.960
Everyone was terrified.

00:09:49.799 --> 00:09:50.679
The previous county magistrate

00:09:51.239 --> 00:09:52.440
to calm the panic,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.919
held a special ritual there.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.200
In the end,

00:09:56.599 --> 00:09:57.919
they even buried Blood Yan Luo

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.599
in the Asura Temple.

00:10:00.119 --> 00:10:01.320
And placed a Soul-suppressing Beast on top.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.640
What does that strange thing mean?

00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:07.200
Xuan Fish Spitting Swallow, a tomb beast.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.359
It's common in Chu tombs.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.280
Chu people love sorcery.

00:10:11.479 --> 00:10:12.200
They use this creature

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.760
to ward off evil and suppress spirits.

00:10:14.919 --> 00:10:16.559
This one looks pretty old.

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:18.960
Seems the magistrate wasn't lying.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.559
Twenty years ago,

00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:22.359
they buried Blood Yan Luo here

00:10:22.679 --> 00:10:24.000
and used this beast to suppress him.

00:10:24.599 --> 00:10:26.479
Why is this all so messy?

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.559
If Blood Yan Luo died twenty years ago,

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.080
then who is in Akang's dream?

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.119
What's the name of the latest missing child?

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.200
Duo Duo.

00:10:35.239 --> 00:10:37.880
My Duo Duo was harmed by that Asura!

00:10:38.599 --> 00:10:39.799
Please, don't cry yet.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.320
If you want to save your son, tell us everything.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.840
My son has always had health issues.

00:10:46.359 --> 00:10:48.159
I heard there's someone in Yunshui County

00:10:48.159 --> 00:10:50.559
who's good at treating children's illnesses.

00:10:51.039 --> 00:10:52.640
So I brought him here to recover.

00:10:53.479 --> 00:10:54.760
But unexpectedly,

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.559
the night we arrived,

00:10:56.559 --> 00:10:57.640
there was a heavy storm.

00:10:58.359 --> 00:10:59.799
We went into that

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.880
Asura Temple.

00:11:05.719 --> 00:11:06.799
Dad, come in quickly!

00:11:10.599 --> 00:11:11.280
Son!

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.000
Dad!

00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:16.359
The guards are still behind us.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.280
Everyone got separated.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.159
What should we do?

00:11:18.359 --> 00:11:18.919
It's fine.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.080
We're almost there.

00:11:20.359 --> 00:11:21.520
Let's wait here.

00:11:21.799 --> 00:11:22.719
They'll catch up soon.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.559
A ghost!

00:11:38.559 --> 00:11:39.039
Ghost!

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.479
Duo Duo!

00:11:40.919 --> 00:11:41.520
Come here, come here.

00:11:44.119 --> 00:11:44.799
There's no ghost.

00:11:47.359 --> 00:11:48.000
Master Qian!

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.799
Why are you in this evil temple?

00:11:50.119 --> 00:11:51.159
There are ghosts inside!

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.359
Hurry, let's go!

00:11:55.039 --> 00:11:55.719
Go, hurry!

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.840
Go, Duo Duo, hurry!

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.599
I never expected

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.799
that filthy thing would target my Duo Duo.

00:12:10.719 --> 00:12:13.320
It even followed us home.

00:12:27.039 --> 00:12:27.559
Alright.

00:12:28.159 --> 00:12:29.440
Young master was probably

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.559
bewitched by something dirty.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.440
Now the Spirit-Dispelling Bell is at the door.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.599
Nothing dirty can get in.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.640
Let the young master take my medicine.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.200
He just needs to rest quietly.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.599
Don't worry, it's nothing serious.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.239
Thank you so much, Divine Doctor Cui.

00:12:42.599 --> 00:12:43.320
Please wait a moment.

00:12:43.479 --> 00:12:45.200
I'll go get your tea money now.

00:13:29.719 --> 00:13:30.520
Master Qian!

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.440
Is that you?

00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:54.039
Young Master Qian!

00:13:54.039 --> 00:13:56.239
Young master! Young master!

00:13:56.239 --> 00:13:57.119
Duo Duo!

00:13:57.119 --> 00:13:58.400
Young master, where are you?

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.559
Young Master Qian!

00:14:01.239 --> 00:14:02.080
Duo Duo!

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.359
Young master!

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.719
Young master!

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.599
Would you like some food?
