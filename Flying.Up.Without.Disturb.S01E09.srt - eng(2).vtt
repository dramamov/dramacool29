Huan Zong.

00:01:52.537 --> 00:01:53.578
Do you...

00:01:53.698 --> 00:01:55.297
Do you fall for anyone?

00:01:57.058 --> 00:01:59.257
Why do you ask that?

00:01:59.377 --> 00:02:00.257
No.

00:02:00.498 --> 00:02:02.017
I was right, wasn't I?

00:02:02.138 --> 00:02:03.338
N-No.

00:02:03.578 --> 00:02:04.418
Impossible.

00:02:05.457 --> 00:02:07.377
Then why are you

00:02:07.537 --> 00:02:09.577
reading these romance storybooks?

00:02:09.738 --> 00:02:11.137
I don't think

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:12.352
you enjoy reading

00:02:12.352 --> 00:02:13.618
romance storybooks.

00:02:13.857 --> 00:02:15.458
So, there must be a reason.

00:02:15.577 --> 00:02:16.178
Right?

00:02:17.938 --> 00:02:19.257
What kind of person

00:02:19.377 --> 00:02:20.577
is she?

00:02:20.657 --> 00:02:21.498
How did

00:02:21.498 --> 00:02:22.577
you meet her?

00:02:22.697 --> 00:02:23.458
Did you tell her

00:02:23.458 --> 00:02:24.338
that you fall for her?

00:02:24.458 --> 00:02:25.697
Does she

00:02:25.697 --> 00:02:26.537
like you too?

00:02:28.498 --> 00:02:31.058
I read these just

00:02:32.298 --> 00:02:33.938
to find out

00:02:34.257 --> 00:02:35.264
the way to confirm

00:02:35.264 --> 00:02:36.178
if I fall for someone.

00:02:36.338 --> 00:02:37.738
But I didn't say I fall for anyone.

00:02:38.218 --> 00:02:38.898
Not at all.

00:02:39.218 --> 00:02:40.898
If you don't fall for anyone,

00:02:40.977 --> 00:02:44.058
then why are you reading these?

00:02:44.657 --> 00:02:45.857
Alright.

00:02:45.977 --> 00:02:48.218
Let's assume you don't fall for anyone.

00:02:48.338 --> 00:02:49.697
Assume?

00:02:49.857 --> 00:02:51.458
No means no.

00:02:52.817 --> 00:02:55.104
Alright, I get it.

00:02:55.498 --> 00:02:56.778
I get it.

00:02:57.938 --> 00:02:58.848
I've read

00:02:58.848 --> 00:02:59.618
these books

00:02:59.618 --> 00:03:00.697
many times.

00:03:00.778 --> 00:03:01.618
No need to read them.

00:03:01.857 --> 00:03:03.040
Just ask me.

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:04.498
I can tell you.

00:03:04.577 --> 00:03:05.298
Tell me.

00:03:05.577 --> 00:03:06.417
When you see

00:03:06.417 --> 00:03:07.697
this girl,

00:03:07.697 --> 00:03:09.537
does your heart

00:03:09.697 --> 00:03:10.898
beat wildly?

00:03:20.778 --> 00:03:22.537
Think about it.

00:03:23.712 --> 00:03:24.697
Do you

00:03:24.697 --> 00:03:26.377
want to protect her?

00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:40.537
If she vanishes from your life,

00:03:41.024 --> 00:03:42.112
will you feel

00:03:42.112 --> 00:03:43.338
very painful?

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.856
Yeah.

00:03:57.856 --> 00:03:58.977
You got it.

00:03:58.977 --> 00:04:00.898
You do fall for her.

00:04:01.376 --> 00:04:02.377
(So,)

00:04:03.137 --> 00:04:04.618
(I really fall for you?)

00:04:10.898 --> 00:04:13.417
Huan Zong, what's the matter with you?

00:04:14.738 --> 00:04:15.938
Thinking about her again?

00:04:17.738 --> 00:04:19.137
I really didn't expect

00:04:19.257 --> 00:04:20.738
that someone as cold as you

00:04:20.738 --> 00:04:21.418
would have

00:04:21.418 --> 00:04:22.658
such an adorable side.

00:04:25.217 --> 00:04:26.697
Let me tell you the truth.

00:04:26.858 --> 00:04:28.738
Actually,

00:04:30.137 --> 00:04:32.017
I did all this for Lin Hu.

00:04:34.817 --> 00:04:36.418
So it's Lin Hu?

00:04:36.618 --> 00:04:37.938
Makes sense.

00:04:38.098 --> 00:04:39.457
Lin Hu

00:04:39.457 --> 00:04:40.864
also seems a bit dense.

00:04:41.984 --> 00:04:42.777
Exactly.

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.337
We're best friends.

00:04:45.457 --> 00:04:46.658
So,

00:04:46.976 --> 00:04:48.137
if he needs help,

00:04:48.257 --> 00:04:49.498
I want to help.

00:04:50.337 --> 00:04:51.418
However, Huan Zong,

00:04:51.498 --> 00:04:53.938
you're really nice to Lin Hu.

00:05:01.817 --> 00:05:03.217
Promise me,

00:05:03.257 --> 00:05:04.736
don't tell Lin Hu about

00:05:04.736 --> 00:05:05.738
the questions

00:05:06.217 --> 00:05:07.137
I asked for him today.

00:05:07.298 --> 00:05:08.577
He has his pride.

00:05:09.298 --> 00:05:11.217
Don't worry. I promise

00:05:11.257 --> 00:05:12.418
I won't say a thing.

00:05:19.577 --> 00:05:20.858
(Registration)
Give me your recommendation letter.

00:05:21.858 --> 00:05:22.738
What?

00:05:23.938 --> 00:05:25.978
What are you doing here without one?

00:05:26.098 --> 00:05:27.168
The Jiao Tong Pavilion

00:05:27.168 --> 00:05:28.224
is not a place for anyone

00:05:28.224 --> 00:05:28.938
to enter.

00:05:29.658 --> 00:05:30.720
Take a good look

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.777
at us.

00:05:31.858 --> 00:05:32.858
Look at us,

00:05:32.897 --> 00:05:34.377
do we still need recommendation?

00:05:35.618 --> 00:05:37.697
Trying to sneak in?

00:05:37.817 --> 00:05:39.058
Leave now.

00:05:39.257 --> 00:05:40.512
Don't waste my time.

00:05:40.896 --> 00:05:42.098
You're insincere.

00:05:42.137 --> 00:05:43.098
(Registration)
Wait, you!

00:05:43.098 --> 00:05:44.178
Why are you so rude?

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.240
We have rules here.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.337
I just follow the rules.

00:05:47.552 --> 00:05:48.538
That's it.

00:05:48.538 --> 00:05:50.137
- What? I...
- Lin Hu.

00:05:51.498 --> 00:05:52.457
Don't cause trouble.

00:05:53.248 --> 00:05:55.217
You can't even control your temper,

00:05:55.217 --> 00:05:57.017
and still want
to get in Jiao Tong Pavilion?

00:05:57.337 --> 00:05:58.098
Buddy,

00:05:58.658 --> 00:05:59.424
could you

00:05:59.424 --> 00:06:00.192
please show us

00:06:00.192 --> 00:06:00.697
the letter?

00:06:08.064 --> 00:06:09.312
Take a close look.

00:06:11.584 --> 00:06:12.896
(Recommendation Letter,
from the Owner of Pingyue House)

00:06:15.577 --> 00:06:16.377
Got it.

00:06:16.512 --> 00:06:17.408
(Registration)

00:06:17.408 --> 00:06:18.017
Here.

00:06:18.058 --> 00:06:18.858
Thank you.

00:06:19.257 --> 00:06:19.858
Let's go.

00:06:20.618 --> 00:06:21.538
Leaving?

00:06:21.697 --> 00:06:22.624
We haven't gone in.

00:06:22.624 --> 00:06:23.137
Let's go.

00:06:33.408 --> 00:06:34.848
Didn't expect

00:06:34.944 --> 00:06:37.777
your faces can't be used
as a recommendation letter.

00:06:38.058 --> 00:06:39.498
Actually, well...

00:06:39.697 --> 00:06:40.618
Sometimes...

00:06:40.618 --> 00:06:41.568
Someone

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:43.938
said confidently

00:06:43.938 --> 00:06:45.577
that there's no place he couldn't go.

00:06:45.856 --> 00:06:46.816
Why did he fail

00:06:46.816 --> 00:06:47.978
at the crucial moment?

00:06:47.978 --> 00:06:48.697
Well, I...

00:06:48.978 --> 00:06:51.538
Lin Hu didn't prepare properly.

00:06:51.938 --> 00:06:53.858
But now we need
to come up with a new plan.

00:06:54.098 --> 00:06:54.738
Right.

00:06:55.418 --> 00:06:56.658
I have an idea.

00:06:58.058 --> 00:06:58.978
Let's hear it.

00:06:59.264 --> 00:07:00.858
We're missing a recommendation letter.

00:07:00.858 --> 00:07:02.217
Then let's make one ourselves.

00:07:02.337 --> 00:07:03.328
How is it?

00:07:03.658 --> 00:07:04.897
No need.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.752
(Recommendation)

00:07:09.777 --> 00:07:11.137
I've prepared it.

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:12.897
(From Owner of Pingyue House)
Here it is.

00:07:13.538 --> 00:07:14.137
Alright.

00:07:14.457 --> 00:07:15.817
This time, everything's ready.

00:07:15.817 --> 00:07:16.858
Let's get going.

00:07:16.858 --> 00:07:17.618
Wait, wait.

00:07:17.978 --> 00:07:19.538
We're still missing one thing.

00:07:28.017 --> 00:07:29.777
- This one...
- No way.

00:07:29.897 --> 00:07:30.624
Another one.

00:07:33.457 --> 00:07:34.858
Try this. Try it.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.400
(Jiao Tong Pavilion)

00:07:43.978 --> 00:07:44.498
Please.

00:07:49.938 --> 00:07:50.577
Lady,

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:51.978
please follow me.

00:07:52.577 --> 00:07:53.978
No need for such formalities.

00:08:03.577 --> 00:08:04.337
This way, please.

00:08:09.377 --> 00:08:10.978
Lady, here.

00:08:11.777 --> 00:08:12.538
Thank you.

00:08:15.178 --> 00:08:16.058
Lady.

00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:20.058
Why the rush?

00:08:20.137 --> 00:08:21.498
You'll get it later.

00:08:21.498 --> 00:08:23.658
- Lady, but...
- Come take it.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.217
You may go.

00:08:30.217 --> 00:08:31.777
Don't disturb the others.

00:08:32.224 --> 00:08:33.152
Thank you, Madam.

00:08:33.152 --> 00:08:34.144
Madam, enjoy.

00:08:39.258 --> 00:08:40.778
Here in the Jiao Tong Pavilion,

00:08:40.778 --> 00:08:41.824
it's all about

00:08:41.824 --> 00:08:42.784
spirit stones.

00:08:43.058 --> 00:08:44.258
Don't let them wait.

00:08:44.378 --> 00:08:45.857
They are all shrewd

00:08:45.857 --> 00:08:46.577
and sharp.

00:08:50.176 --> 00:08:51.018
I'm

00:08:51.018 --> 00:08:52.617
not that stingy.

00:08:57.138 --> 00:08:58.178
Your first time here?

00:08:58.938 --> 00:08:59.617
Yes.

00:09:00.138 --> 00:09:01.737
There will be new performers today.

00:09:01.857 --> 00:09:02.688
It is said

00:09:02.688 --> 00:09:04.097
each one is quite talented.

00:09:04.217 --> 00:09:05.504
Hopefully, there will be some

00:09:05.504 --> 00:09:06.737
who are talented and pretty.

00:09:06.898 --> 00:09:08.737
The new performers

00:09:08.898 --> 00:09:10.018
don't know anything.

00:09:10.018 --> 00:09:11.138
What's the fun?

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:13.977
They need to be taught well.

00:09:14.857 --> 00:09:16.138
You got the hang of it.

00:09:17.337 --> 00:09:19.538
I've studied it.

00:09:25.857 --> 00:09:26.418
By the way,

00:09:26.977 --> 00:09:28.778
where's Jiao Tong?

00:09:32.298 --> 00:09:33.058
What's wrong?

00:09:33.457 --> 00:09:34.624
We can't see him?

00:09:39.457 --> 00:09:40.378
Next one.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.568
Please.

00:09:42.976 --> 00:09:43.616
Please.

00:09:46.138 --> 00:09:46.898
Hello, everyone.

00:09:53.337 --> 00:09:54.418
Pretty boy,

00:09:54.977 --> 00:09:56.658
your looks and qualifications

00:09:56.864 --> 00:09:58.080
don't quite match

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.744
our requirements.

00:09:59.898 --> 00:10:01.664
Please seek another opportunity.

00:10:02.577 --> 00:10:04.058
Wait!

00:10:04.058 --> 00:10:05.938
Sir, I understand.

00:10:06.058 --> 00:10:07.138
Well, my looks

00:10:07.298 --> 00:10:08.977
may not be top-notch.

00:10:09.138 --> 00:10:09.857
Everyone,

00:10:10.018 --> 00:10:11.872
you're all smart

00:10:11.872 --> 00:10:12.817
and discerning,

00:10:12.817 --> 00:10:13.737
having seen so many.

00:10:13.737 --> 00:10:15.457
You must've heard one saying.

00:10:15.457 --> 00:10:17.337
Don't judge a book

00:10:17.337 --> 00:10:18.857
from its cover.

00:10:19.968 --> 00:10:21.378
Then how can we see

00:10:21.378 --> 00:10:22.658
the content of you?

00:10:22.658 --> 00:10:23.178
Well,

00:10:23.337 --> 00:10:25.138
I'll show you.

00:10:25.258 --> 00:10:26.658
Get ready.

00:10:27.097 --> 00:10:27.977
Well...

00:10:30.497 --> 00:10:31.898
Lend me this.

00:10:31.898 --> 00:10:33.088
I'll start now.

00:10:33.184 --> 00:10:33.737
Well,

00:10:33.938 --> 00:10:37.178
at the peak of this imperial city...

00:10:51.904 --> 00:10:52.800
Enough.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.408
After that...

00:10:53.408 --> 00:10:54.298
Stop.

00:10:55.737 --> 00:10:57.658
You have a quick mind,

00:10:57.778 --> 00:10:59.018
and a sharp tongue.

00:10:59.058 --> 00:11:00.058
I know.

00:11:00.617 --> 00:11:01.617
What do

00:11:01.778 --> 00:11:02.778
you two think?

00:11:03.058 --> 00:11:05.217
I think this is the best.

00:11:05.792 --> 00:11:07.008
You have a keen eye.

00:11:09.376 --> 00:11:09.977
Next one.

00:11:25.258 --> 00:11:27.178
Could he be the best?

00:11:38.658 --> 00:11:39.977
May I ask

00:11:40.058 --> 00:11:41.298
if you have any talents?

00:11:41.497 --> 00:11:42.497
For example?

00:11:42.752 --> 00:11:44.032
Music, chess, calligraphy,

00:11:44.032 --> 00:11:45.018
or painting.

00:11:45.337 --> 00:11:47.737
So, they are talents?

00:11:49.658 --> 00:11:52.138
Nice taste.

00:11:52.497 --> 00:11:55.097
Congratulations on being admitted.

00:11:56.697 --> 00:11:57.977
Congratulations.

00:12:00.617 --> 00:12:01.938
I passed?

00:12:07.552 --> 00:12:08.672
Just now,

00:12:08.672 --> 00:12:09.737
it's only the preliminary.

00:12:09.737 --> 00:12:11.258
Don't be too smug.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.217
Whether you can stay,

00:12:13.217 --> 00:12:14.816
it depends on if anyone

00:12:14.816 --> 00:12:16.258
- This Jiao Tong Pavilion
- supports you.

00:12:16.258 --> 00:12:17.258
is very superficial.

00:12:17.617 --> 00:12:19.497
They require a talent show,

00:12:19.577 --> 00:12:20.928
but you've passed

00:12:20.928 --> 00:12:22.080
before you performed.

00:12:22.298 --> 00:12:24.217
The definition of talent here

00:12:24.217 --> 00:12:25.298
is a bit unique.

00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:26.977
Who cares?

00:12:26.977 --> 00:12:28.298
Just be cautious.

00:12:28.538 --> 00:12:29.538
Of what?

00:12:29.898 --> 00:12:30.697
Of what?

00:12:30.737 --> 00:12:32.817
Traps, pitfalls.

00:12:33.058 --> 00:12:34.097
Traps?

00:12:34.457 --> 00:12:35.497
I've only fallen for

00:12:35.497 --> 00:12:36.576
traps set by Kong Hou.

00:12:37.378 --> 00:12:38.217
Hearing her name

00:12:38.217 --> 00:12:39.178
makes me angry.

00:12:39.258 --> 00:12:39.938
Let me tell you.

00:12:39.938 --> 00:12:40.704
- If it weren't for her,
- You guys

00:12:40.704 --> 00:12:41.857
- we'd never be here.
- have to listen to me.

00:12:41.857 --> 00:12:42.528
She knows

00:12:42.528 --> 00:12:43.697
the purpose of our visit.

00:12:44.256 --> 00:12:46.977
- Fine, keep defending her.
- If not,

00:12:46.977 --> 00:12:48.977
then you'll have to leave.

00:12:51.337 --> 00:12:52.178
You...

00:12:52.337 --> 00:12:53.760
What? Me? Lin Hu.

00:12:54.378 --> 00:12:55.258
Lin Hu,

00:12:55.258 --> 00:12:56.928
you'll go straight

00:12:56.928 --> 00:12:57.984
to the kitchen.

00:12:58.368 --> 00:12:59.418
K-Kitchen?

00:13:59.712 --> 00:14:01.344
Such a good figure.

00:14:15.488 --> 00:14:16.256
Impressive.

00:14:16.256 --> 00:14:17.298
Excellent.

00:14:17.898 --> 00:14:18.737
Mine.

00:14:20.577 --> 00:14:21.728
Excellent.

00:14:22.018 --> 00:14:23.577
- He's great.
- Yeah.

00:14:28.418 --> 00:14:29.457
That's him.

00:14:29.538 --> 00:14:31.418
His talent is excellent.

00:14:37.977 --> 00:14:39.538
That's really rude.

00:14:39.577 --> 00:14:40.658
Who did it?

00:14:40.697 --> 00:14:42.977
What if it hurts him?

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:48.778
Well...

00:14:48.898 --> 00:14:51.018
I didn't mean it.

00:14:57.697 --> 00:14:59.418
Hey, hey.

00:14:59.697 --> 00:15:00.448
Come.

00:15:09.817 --> 00:15:11.178
A tip for him.

00:15:11.898 --> 00:15:13.258
Thank you.

00:15:16.058 --> 00:15:17.737
T-This is good.

00:15:17.938 --> 00:15:18.857
It's good.

00:15:19.778 --> 00:15:20.857
Good then.

00:15:26.337 --> 00:15:27.138
Here is

00:15:27.328 --> 00:15:28.800
where we prepare

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.337
food for guests.

00:15:31.217 --> 00:15:31.872
Take a tour

00:15:31.872 --> 00:15:32.864
around here.

00:15:33.817 --> 00:15:34.977
It's quite lively.

00:15:35.898 --> 00:15:37.378
Excuse me.

00:15:37.538 --> 00:15:39.097
I have a question

00:15:39.138 --> 00:15:40.378
to ask.

00:15:40.457 --> 00:15:42.217
Don't ask questions unrelated to work.

00:15:42.378 --> 00:15:43.936
This is very related to work.

00:15:43.936 --> 00:15:45.217
This is about work.

00:15:45.217 --> 00:15:46.138
Go ahead.

00:15:46.272 --> 00:15:47.418
What do you want to ask?

00:15:47.418 --> 00:15:49.138
I just really want to know

00:15:49.138 --> 00:15:50.368
when I can meet

00:15:50.368 --> 00:15:51.658
Jiao Tong.

00:15:51.817 --> 00:15:53.440
I really admire his talent.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.658
- I want to learn from him.
- Another one.

00:15:55.977 --> 00:15:57.376
What are you people

00:15:57.376 --> 00:15:58.658
thinking about every day?

00:15:58.817 --> 00:16:00.018
Getting in Jiao Tong Pavilion

00:16:00.178 --> 00:16:01.696
won't make you be

00:16:01.696 --> 00:16:02.658
with Jiao Tong.

00:16:02.697 --> 00:16:03.488
Not really.

00:16:03.488 --> 00:16:04.857
Who do you think Jiao Tong is?

00:16:05.018 --> 00:16:06.138
Don't even think about it.

00:16:07.577 --> 00:16:09.018
This is your job.

00:16:09.737 --> 00:16:10.977
Work hard.

00:16:11.217 --> 00:16:12.736
Wait, this...

00:16:12.736 --> 00:16:15.178
Sir, this...

00:16:16.928 --> 00:16:17.697
Hurry up.

00:16:21.258 --> 00:16:22.778
This is my job?

00:16:41.824 --> 00:16:43.457
Bravo.

00:16:53.097 --> 00:16:55.178
Sounds good.

00:17:41.818 --> 00:17:43.017
Excellent.

00:17:46.138 --> 00:17:46.898
(Impressive.)

00:17:46.898 --> 00:17:48.057
(Anything you can't do?)

00:17:49.257 --> 00:17:50.378
(I can't play the pipa.)

00:17:51.017 --> 00:17:52.898
(That's not what I meant.)

00:17:54.017 --> 00:17:57.457
(I can play the zheng,
sheng, flute, and ruan.)

00:17:57.792 --> 00:17:58.777
(Enough.)

00:17:58.977 --> 00:18:00.777
(You can't play it so well.)

00:18:01.297 --> 00:18:02.017
(Why?)

00:18:02.457 --> 00:18:04.217
(We have a mission.)

00:18:04.257 --> 00:18:05.297
(Remember?)

00:18:07.418 --> 00:18:08.777
(Jiao Tong?)

00:18:09.257 --> 00:18:11.697
(Yes, Jiao Tong.)

00:18:11.697 --> 00:18:12.818
(You mean,)

00:18:12.898 --> 00:18:14.618
(I play the flute badly,)

00:18:14.618 --> 00:18:15.777
(and he will show up)

00:18:15.858 --> 00:18:16.658
(to stop me?)

00:18:16.898 --> 00:18:18.618
(Exactly.)

00:18:18.618 --> 00:18:19.257
(Okay.)

00:18:19.578 --> 00:18:20.497
(I'll do as you wish.)

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.378
(The worse, the better.)

00:18:22.578 --> 00:18:23.392
One more.

00:18:23.392 --> 00:18:24.898
One more.

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:26.378
One more.

00:18:26.378 --> 00:18:27.338
One more.

00:18:27.338 --> 00:18:28.618
One more.

00:18:28.618 --> 00:18:29.628
Exactly.

00:18:29.628 --> 00:18:30.138
Right.

00:18:30.297 --> 00:18:31.658
One more.

00:18:31.658 --> 00:18:33.858
- Pretty boy, one more.
- Right.

00:18:42.338 --> 00:18:44.697
What's going on? It's terrible.

00:18:45.408 --> 00:18:46.977
A stand-in is hiding behind?

00:18:47.057 --> 00:18:48.378
Come out, stand-in.

00:18:48.418 --> 00:18:49.472
Right.

00:18:50.737 --> 00:18:52.858
It's so terrible. What's happening?

00:18:55.818 --> 00:18:57.152
- Get off.
- Get off.

00:18:57.152 --> 00:18:59.578
- Refund.
- Refund.

00:18:59.578 --> 00:19:00.704
Get off the stage.

00:19:00.704 --> 00:19:01.737
I think

00:19:03.658 --> 00:19:04.737
it's not that bad.

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:06.898
This is tormenting.

00:19:06.898 --> 00:19:08.057
Exactly.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.128
Sorry for startling you.

00:19:34.898 --> 00:19:36.858
Let me offer a piece

00:19:37.378 --> 00:19:38.938
as an apology.

00:19:43.392 --> 00:19:45.568
What happened just now?

00:19:45.818 --> 00:19:46.977
Is it about the flute?

00:19:48.138 --> 00:19:49.024
Doesn't matter.

00:19:49.257 --> 00:19:50.217
What matters now is

00:19:50.938 --> 00:19:52.737
I saw him.

00:19:55.257 --> 00:19:56.192
I know it.

00:19:56.338 --> 00:19:58.144
You played badly on purpose

00:19:58.144 --> 00:19:59.297
to lure him out.

00:19:59.297 --> 00:19:59.858
Right?

00:20:01.178 --> 00:20:02.457
But doing so,

00:20:02.537 --> 00:20:03.977
I didn't expect this outcome.

00:20:04.457 --> 00:20:05.537
It's a bit troublesome.

00:20:05.578 --> 00:20:06.297
It's okay.

00:20:06.378 --> 00:20:07.618
I'm here.

00:20:07.658 --> 00:20:08.697
Leave the rest to me.

00:20:10.537 --> 00:20:11.618
At least,

00:20:11.777 --> 00:20:12.672
we saw

00:20:12.672 --> 00:20:14.048
Jiao Tong today.

00:20:15.098 --> 00:20:15.658
Yes.

00:20:15.938 --> 00:20:17.658
So what do we do

00:20:17.658 --> 00:20:18.777
next?

00:20:21.898 --> 00:20:23.136
Go and observe

00:20:23.136 --> 00:20:24.297
Jiao Tong's room.

00:20:24.297 --> 00:20:25.977
Pay attention to his daily life

00:20:26.858 --> 00:20:27.712
and schedule.

00:20:32.217 --> 00:20:33.977
We've gone through so much effort.

00:20:34.418 --> 00:20:36.858
Huan Zong wasn't dismissed for nothing.

00:20:36.977 --> 00:20:37.658
But

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:39.818
what should we do next?

00:20:39.858 --> 00:20:41.497
The performers today

00:20:41.537 --> 00:20:43.418
are exceptionally handsome.

00:20:43.418 --> 00:20:45.138
- Yeah.
- Especially the pretty boy

00:20:45.138 --> 00:20:46.777
who played the flute.

00:20:46.777 --> 00:20:47.977
Yes, yes.

00:20:48.578 --> 00:20:50.217
Even though his playing is a bit off,

00:20:50.338 --> 00:20:51.658
that's not important.

00:20:51.737 --> 00:20:54.257
His elegance charms me.

00:20:54.297 --> 00:20:55.618
- Yes, yes.
- Yes, yes.

00:20:55.618 --> 00:20:57.088
We share the same taste.

00:20:57.088 --> 00:20:58.497
I've taken a special liking to him.

00:20:58.697 --> 00:20:59.457
Right? Right?

00:20:59.457 --> 00:21:00.378
Right.

00:21:00.378 --> 00:21:01.618
Exactly.

00:21:01.658 --> 00:21:02.497
I wonder

00:21:02.497 --> 00:21:03.658
what tier he's in.

00:21:03.737 --> 00:21:05.138
If we buy his meeting token,

00:21:05.138 --> 00:21:06.378
we can meet him in private,

00:21:06.378 --> 00:21:07.737
right?

00:21:09.938 --> 00:21:10.938
I've heard...

00:21:10.977 --> 00:21:12.297
Meet in private?

00:21:13.017 --> 00:21:14.257
No way.

00:21:14.378 --> 00:21:15.217
Young ladies.

00:21:15.297 --> 00:21:16.138
Young ladies.

00:21:16.178 --> 00:21:17.737
Are you talking about

00:21:17.858 --> 00:21:19.457
the young man playing the flute?

00:21:19.618 --> 00:21:20.384
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:21:20.384 --> 00:21:21.217
What?

00:21:21.217 --> 00:21:22.297
Do you like him too?

00:21:22.338 --> 00:21:23.977
It's a shame he got dismissed.

00:21:24.938 --> 00:21:26.697
I'll take you to see him.

00:21:26.977 --> 00:21:27.618
And you'll

00:21:27.618 --> 00:21:29.658
take me to see Jiao Tong.

00:21:29.697 --> 00:21:30.297
How about it?

00:21:30.977 --> 00:21:31.938
Anyone who spends

00:21:31.938 --> 00:21:33.057
at least 2,000 spirit stones

00:21:33.057 --> 00:21:34.178
is considered tier one.

00:21:34.257 --> 00:21:36.578
And you need to be at least tier ten

00:21:36.578 --> 00:21:38.560
to buy his meeting token.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.858
Not to mention it,

00:21:39.858 --> 00:21:41.378
the key is...

00:21:41.858 --> 00:21:42.898
What's the key?

00:21:43.457 --> 00:21:45.257
I've finally found you.

00:21:45.537 --> 00:21:47.257
It requires 100,000 spirit stones.

00:21:47.338 --> 00:21:48.898
100,000 spirit stones?

00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:50.537
How am I supposed to save that much?

00:21:50.578 --> 00:21:51.457
Exactly.

00:21:51.537 --> 00:21:52.297
Continue.

00:21:52.338 --> 00:21:53.217
Continue.

00:22:01.858 --> 00:22:03.977
100,000 spirit stones...

00:22:15.017 --> 00:22:15.658
This

00:22:16.578 --> 00:22:17.888
is what I have.

00:22:18.592 --> 00:22:19.904
How's that possible?

00:22:33.777 --> 00:22:35.618
Young lady, what's wrong?

00:22:38.178 --> 00:22:39.497
It's you.

00:22:40.297 --> 00:22:42.497
Did they rip you

00:22:42.697 --> 00:22:43.457
off?

00:22:45.418 --> 00:22:47.418
Miss, I remember you.

00:22:48.818 --> 00:22:50.977
I think

00:22:51.737 --> 00:22:53.618
I got the lovesickness.

00:22:55.138 --> 00:22:57.697
Lovesickness?

00:22:58.178 --> 00:22:59.178
Among today's

00:22:59.178 --> 00:23:00.032
performers,

00:23:00.578 --> 00:23:02.578
there's one I'm quite fond of,

00:23:03.138 --> 00:23:04.777
but he didn't stay.

00:23:05.472 --> 00:23:06.977
I went out to find him,

00:23:07.257 --> 00:23:08.818
yet he had already left.

00:23:09.536 --> 00:23:11.938
Well, which one?

00:23:13.737 --> 00:23:16.297
Is it

00:23:16.818 --> 00:23:17.858
him?

00:23:20.497 --> 00:23:22.737
I saw him save you.

00:23:22.898 --> 00:23:25.297
Did you know each other?

00:23:27.616 --> 00:23:29.697
Miss, please help.

00:23:30.017 --> 00:23:31.537
I want to see him.

00:23:35.217 --> 00:23:37.297
L-Let me think.

00:23:40.938 --> 00:23:42.138
That Madam Chen

00:23:42.138 --> 00:23:43.497
doesn't seem like a bad person.

00:23:43.658 --> 00:23:45.057
No, no way.

00:23:46.057 --> 00:23:47.378
But for now,

00:23:47.378 --> 00:23:49.297
this is the only way.

00:23:52.672 --> 00:23:54.257
Huan Zong, why are you here?

00:23:54.378 --> 00:23:55.537
Waiting for you.

00:23:55.697 --> 00:23:57.658
This is Zhong Xi from Liuguang Sect.

00:23:57.658 --> 00:23:58.618
Why is he here?

00:23:58.618 --> 00:23:59.378
Waiting for me?

00:24:00.128 --> 00:24:01.618
Did everything go smoothly?

00:24:02.338 --> 00:24:03.858
Of course.

00:24:04.497 --> 00:24:05.138
Let's go.

00:24:15.697 --> 00:24:17.338
It seems I need

00:24:17.376 --> 00:24:19.418
to figure out a complete plan.

00:24:20.297 --> 00:24:22.858
Huan Zong, please help.

00:24:22.977 --> 00:24:24.178
That Madam Chen

00:24:24.178 --> 00:24:25.858
doesn't seem like a bad person.

00:24:25.898 --> 00:24:27.777
She just admires you

00:24:27.777 --> 00:24:28.618
and adores you.

00:24:28.697 --> 00:24:30.858
She has no bad intentions.

00:24:31.378 --> 00:24:32.457
No way.

00:24:32.497 --> 00:24:33.737
I reject.

00:24:38.697 --> 00:24:40.297
Huan Zong, you know

00:24:40.297 --> 00:24:42.240
how difficult to meet

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.697
Jiao Tong.

00:24:43.777 --> 00:24:45.024
It costs 100,000 spirit stones

00:24:45.024 --> 00:24:47.138
at the Jiao Tong Pavilion.

00:24:47.217 --> 00:24:47.858
And,

00:24:48.017 --> 00:24:50.537
it has to be a regular customer
for over three years.

00:24:50.537 --> 00:24:51.658
Only a major customer

00:24:51.658 --> 00:24:52.618
like Madam Chen

00:24:52.992 --> 00:24:54.048
can get

00:24:54.048 --> 00:24:55.537
the rare meeting token.

00:24:55.537 --> 00:24:58.618
And it's one-on-one.

00:24:58.858 --> 00:24:59.904
But you can't

00:24:59.904 --> 00:25:00.864
sell me out

00:25:00.864 --> 00:25:02.017
because of it.

00:25:02.138 --> 00:25:03.418
What do you take me for?

00:25:03.858 --> 00:25:04.457
I...

00:25:04.457 --> 00:25:05.138
Besides,

00:25:05.536 --> 00:25:07.098
I don't know Madam Chen at all.

00:25:07.178 --> 00:25:07.977
I'm afraid

00:25:08.098 --> 00:25:09.338
I can't do it.

00:25:11.104 --> 00:25:12.128
I really

00:25:12.128 --> 00:25:13.858
can't come up

00:25:13.858 --> 00:25:15.138
with any other options.

00:25:16.658 --> 00:25:17.568
Then I should

00:25:17.568 --> 00:25:19.457
think of another solution.

00:25:19.618 --> 00:25:20.618
How about this?

00:25:21.088 --> 00:25:23.257
Tomorrow, I'll go to

00:25:23.858 --> 00:25:25.697
Pingyue House

00:25:26.098 --> 00:25:27.616
and see if there's

00:25:27.616 --> 00:25:28.416
any other

00:25:28.416 --> 00:25:29.737
pretty boys.

00:25:32.057 --> 00:25:34.457
Find other pretty boys?

00:25:36.832 --> 00:25:38.138
I really

00:25:38.138 --> 00:25:40.138
have no other options.

00:25:40.378 --> 00:25:41.457
I wonder

00:25:41.457 --> 00:25:42.737
if I can find

00:25:42.944 --> 00:25:44.138
someone

00:25:44.138 --> 00:25:46.017
like you.

00:25:46.977 --> 00:25:48.737
Find some similar ones

00:25:48.737 --> 00:25:49.658
and make do.

00:25:52.416 --> 00:25:53.378
Come on.

00:25:53.777 --> 00:25:55.537
Stop that.

00:25:56.217 --> 00:25:57.257
I'll give it a try.

00:25:57.938 --> 00:25:58.658
Really?

00:25:59.418 --> 00:26:00.257
Huan Zong,

00:26:00.297 --> 00:26:01.697
didn't you just say

00:26:01.777 --> 00:26:02.658
you couldn't do it?

00:26:02.737 --> 00:26:04.537
It's okay to try.

00:26:04.777 --> 00:26:05.737
But remember one thing.

00:26:06.378 --> 00:26:08.224
Don't go find pretty boys.

00:26:09.338 --> 00:26:10.178
Don't worry.

00:26:10.378 --> 00:26:11.777
Once it's done,

00:26:11.938 --> 00:26:13.858
I'll definitely make up for you.

00:26:15.138 --> 00:26:16.257
How?

00:26:17.578 --> 00:26:18.537
Well,

00:26:19.098 --> 00:26:20.338
how?

00:26:20.338 --> 00:26:21.257
How about this?

00:26:22.338 --> 00:26:24.057
You'll owe me this time,

00:26:24.418 --> 00:26:26.138
and repay it later.

00:26:26.138 --> 00:26:26.697
Alright.

00:26:28.497 --> 00:26:29.297
Pour some tea.

00:26:29.737 --> 00:26:31.017
Yes.

00:26:36.618 --> 00:26:38.240
I wonder why I came

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.017
here.

00:26:39.257 --> 00:26:40.256
Just to help

00:26:41.312 --> 00:26:42.297
Kong Hou.

00:26:42.656 --> 00:26:44.297
Now I have to wash dishes.

00:26:44.416 --> 00:26:46.098
T-There are so many dishes.

00:26:46.138 --> 00:26:47.098
I really don't know

00:26:47.098 --> 00:26:48.658
how long I'll have to wash them for.

00:26:51.457 --> 00:26:52.217
Hey, newcomer.

00:26:52.418 --> 00:26:53.217
Hurry up.

00:26:53.217 --> 00:26:53.984
We need them.

00:26:54.697 --> 00:26:55.297
Wait.

00:26:56.378 --> 00:26:57.178
That many?

00:26:57.658 --> 00:26:58.944
There's plenty here.

00:27:01.344 --> 00:27:02.858
How can I finish them all?

00:27:09.858 --> 00:27:10.697
Young Master,

00:27:10.818 --> 00:27:12.858
could you change into this outfit?

00:27:20.896 --> 00:27:22.938
Don't mind these.

00:27:23.098 --> 00:27:23.697
Maybe

00:27:23.776 --> 00:27:25.178
she likes it.

00:27:25.537 --> 00:27:26.418
Hurry.

00:27:32.098 --> 00:27:34.658
Young Master, take your time.

00:27:40.858 --> 00:27:43.658
Madam Chen is quite interesting.

00:27:45.977 --> 00:27:47.418
I need to change clothes.

00:27:47.457 --> 00:27:48.418
But you are here.

00:27:49.858 --> 00:27:50.977
I forgot it.

00:27:52.098 --> 00:27:52.704
However,

00:27:52.704 --> 00:27:54.080
if I stay alone

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.178
with Madam Chen outside,

00:27:55.338 --> 00:27:56.858
it would be awkward.

00:27:57.408 --> 00:27:59.297
Don't worry, just go change.

00:27:59.338 --> 00:27:59.938
I won't look.

00:28:29.472 --> 00:28:32.017
Why is it taking so long?

00:28:32.938 --> 00:28:34.858
This is a bit complicated to wear.

00:28:36.704 --> 00:28:37.792
You said you wouldn't look.

00:28:37.792 --> 00:28:38.858
Why did you come over?

00:28:39.744 --> 00:28:40.898
You took a while,

00:28:40.898 --> 00:28:42.016
so I'm here

00:28:42.016 --> 00:28:42.737
to check on you.

00:28:43.616 --> 00:28:44.288
Besides,

00:28:44.288 --> 00:28:44.832
you are

00:28:44.832 --> 00:28:46.297
almost dressed already.

00:28:47.578 --> 00:28:48.777
This outfit

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.048
doesn't seem to be

00:28:50.048 --> 00:28:51.737
the current style.

00:28:52.297 --> 00:28:53.658
Let me help you.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.537
Otherwise, Madam Chen

00:28:55.537 --> 00:28:56.658
might get anxious waiting.

00:29:24.297 --> 00:29:24.938
What's wrong?

00:29:25.537 --> 00:29:26.697
Maybe

00:29:26.737 --> 00:29:28.800
Madam Chen thinks

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.697
you resemble someone,

00:29:29.898 --> 00:29:31.537
so she is so fond of you.

00:29:31.578 --> 00:29:33.737
Even asking you to change your outfit.

00:29:34.618 --> 00:29:35.777
Why do you say that?

00:29:36.578 --> 00:29:38.777
That's what the storybooks would say.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.977
Who does Madam Chen think

00:29:42.178 --> 00:29:43.737
you resemble?

00:29:46.688 --> 00:29:47.818
This outfit

00:29:47.818 --> 00:29:49.017
looks like

00:29:49.376 --> 00:29:51.537
an attire of royal nobility.

00:29:54.624 --> 00:29:55.392
I prepared

00:29:55.392 --> 00:29:56.537
all these for you.

00:29:56.896 --> 00:29:58.138
You will definitely like it.

00:30:05.344 --> 00:30:07.296
(Oh no, Huan Zong is fasting.)

00:30:17.697 --> 00:30:20.017
Huan Zong, eat more.

00:30:23.737 --> 00:30:25.578
Huan Zong, the fish ball tastes good.

00:30:25.664 --> 00:30:26.720
Pick another one for me.

00:30:28.608 --> 00:30:29.618
Oh my.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.280
Madam Chen, look.

00:30:34.898 --> 00:30:35.818
What's that?

00:30:38.297 --> 00:30:39.680
What do you want me to look at?

00:30:40.017 --> 00:30:41.216
Nothing, I was mistaken.

00:30:42.338 --> 00:30:43.938
Here, try the chicken.

00:30:52.257 --> 00:30:53.178
Huan Zong,

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.178
could you shell some walnuts?

00:30:55.257 --> 00:30:56.618
It's my favorite.

00:31:08.537 --> 00:31:10.418
I'll take another one.
This one isn't done.

00:31:15.098 --> 00:31:16.898
Why are you so clumsy?

00:31:17.017 --> 00:31:18.578
Can't even shell a walnut.

00:31:18.898 --> 00:31:20.418
You'd do it then.

00:31:21.858 --> 00:31:22.938
Me?

00:31:23.138 --> 00:31:24.898
Then the secret will be out.

00:31:24.898 --> 00:31:25.537
Stop talking.

00:31:27.098 --> 00:31:28.457
We once

00:31:29.418 --> 00:31:31.072
were as close as you are now.

00:31:37.297 --> 00:31:38.497
Madam Chen,

00:31:38.752 --> 00:31:39.584
we didn't mean

00:31:39.584 --> 00:31:40.777
to deceive you.

00:31:41.098 --> 00:31:41.977
No problem.

00:31:42.618 --> 00:31:44.418
Seeing you two

00:31:44.618 --> 00:31:46.080
being intimate

00:31:46.818 --> 00:31:48.064
makes me envious.

00:31:49.024 --> 00:31:50.378
N-No.

00:31:50.457 --> 00:31:53.057
W-We aren't...

00:31:53.777 --> 00:31:55.697
The reason I wanted to see Huan Zong

00:31:56.178 --> 00:31:57.338
is

00:31:57.737 --> 00:32:00.064
that he looks very much like my lover.

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.144
But my lover

00:32:02.144 --> 00:32:03.537
is a prince of Lingyou Realm.

00:32:04.512 --> 00:32:06.338
We aren't destined to be together.

00:32:06.658 --> 00:32:08.416
He has to return to the palace

00:32:08.416 --> 00:32:09.457
each afternoon.

00:32:09.984 --> 00:32:10.912
So he never

00:32:10.912 --> 00:32:12.457
watched the sunset with me.

00:32:13.178 --> 00:32:14.457
What I want most

00:32:14.977 --> 00:32:16.618
is to watch sunset with him

00:32:17.017 --> 00:32:18.378
just once.

00:32:33.418 --> 00:32:34.297
You've worked so hard

00:32:34.297 --> 00:32:35.697
to get this token

00:32:36.057 --> 00:32:37.618
just to send the woman you love

00:32:37.618 --> 00:32:39.138
to another man?

00:32:40.138 --> 00:32:40.898
No,

00:32:41.697 --> 00:32:43.297
we're not in relationship.

00:32:43.578 --> 00:32:45.457
Then why do you do so much for her?

00:32:49.457 --> 00:32:50.818
You can

00:32:50.977 --> 00:32:52.320
deceive yourself,

00:32:54.537 --> 00:32:55.737
but can't deceive others.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.520
Didn't expect
Madam Chen wanted to see you

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.977
for such a reason.

00:33:05.257 --> 00:33:06.777
Did we do a good deed

00:33:06.777 --> 00:33:07.658
by chance?

00:33:09.217 --> 00:33:10.017
But Huan Zong,

00:33:10.537 --> 00:33:12.096
why do you look like

00:33:12.096 --> 00:33:13.858
someone from the Lingyou Realm royalty?

00:33:14.057 --> 00:33:14.977
Why would I know?

00:33:15.578 --> 00:33:16.697
Probably

00:33:16.697 --> 00:33:17.697
good-looking people

00:33:17.697 --> 00:33:18.537
all look alike.

00:33:20.098 --> 00:33:21.178
Anyway,

00:33:21.418 --> 00:33:22.217
thank you.

00:33:23.136 --> 00:33:24.098
Okay, you can head back.

00:33:24.288 --> 00:33:25.376
I need to find

00:33:25.376 --> 00:33:26.257
Jiao Tong.

00:33:27.697 --> 00:33:28.777
What do you mean?

00:33:29.057 --> 00:33:30.752
Now you're abandoning me?

00:33:31.178 --> 00:33:31.858
No.

00:33:31.858 --> 00:33:33.297
I'm just in a hurry

00:33:33.297 --> 00:33:34.898
to meet Jiao Tong.

00:33:35.712 --> 00:33:37.440
What for?

00:33:37.696 --> 00:33:38.688
It's still early.

00:33:38.688 --> 00:33:39.872
The Jiao Tong Pavilion

00:33:39.872 --> 00:33:41.138
isn't even open yet.

00:33:41.338 --> 00:33:42.178
I think

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.737
we should head back to the inn.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.696
I have some important things

00:33:45.696 --> 00:33:46.432
to tell you.

00:33:46.537 --> 00:33:48.418
You're always thoughtful.

00:33:48.418 --> 00:33:50.618
I should get prepared.

00:33:50.688 --> 00:33:52.658
Let's go back to the inn first.

00:33:52.818 --> 00:33:53.537
I need

00:33:53.537 --> 00:33:55.257
to freshen up and get dressed.

00:33:55.338 --> 00:33:56.178
Then I'll go meet

00:33:56.178 --> 00:33:57.217
Jiao Tong.

00:33:57.338 --> 00:33:58.537
That's not what I meant.

00:33:58.537 --> 00:33:59.328
I mean...

00:33:59.328 --> 00:34:00.256
Let's go.

00:34:00.256 --> 00:34:00.777
Let's go.

00:34:04.608 --> 00:34:05.457
Does it look good?

00:34:07.217 --> 00:34:08.537
Yes,

00:34:08.778 --> 00:34:09.898
but it doesn't matter.

00:34:10.698 --> 00:34:11.680
Looking good matters.

00:34:12.497 --> 00:34:13.657
Remember.

00:34:14.298 --> 00:34:17.024
Once you leave your cup,
don't drink from it again.

00:34:17.344 --> 00:34:18.338
The same goes for food.

00:34:18.338 --> 00:34:19.457
Be cautious of

00:34:19.457 --> 00:34:20.818
those with ill intentions

00:34:20.818 --> 00:34:21.778
poisoning you.

00:34:22.304 --> 00:34:23.584
I'll be fine.

00:34:23.584 --> 00:34:24.778
I'm immune to all poisons.

00:34:24.938 --> 00:34:25.698
Second,

00:34:26.368 --> 00:34:27.858
if no one else is around

00:34:27.858 --> 00:34:29.378
and you are with Jiao Tong

00:34:29.378 --> 00:34:30.457
in a room alone,

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.416
don't let him get close to you.

00:34:32.577 --> 00:34:33.738
Keep your distance.

00:34:35.712 --> 00:34:37.696
But I'm going to learn
how to play the qin.

00:34:37.696 --> 00:34:38.560
Then

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.218
there will definitely be close contact.

00:34:40.544 --> 00:34:41.696
I've heard

00:34:41.696 --> 00:34:42.698
the teacher has to teach

00:34:42.698 --> 00:34:44.898
by taking the student's hand.

00:34:45.184 --> 00:34:47.378
What? That's insane.

00:34:48.298 --> 00:34:49.738
Don't let him touch you.

00:34:50.112 --> 00:34:51.657
Huan Zong, why not?

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.338
I'll learn how to play the qin.

00:34:53.568 --> 00:34:54.432
No need to mind

00:34:54.432 --> 00:34:56.177
these formalities.

00:34:56.378 --> 00:34:56.992
Besides,

00:34:56.992 --> 00:34:58.457
that Jiao Tong is amazing.

00:34:58.457 --> 00:34:59.137
Yes.

00:34:59.457 --> 00:35:01.177
He is indeed amazing,

00:35:01.298 --> 00:35:02.657
the best music cultivator.

00:35:02.976 --> 00:35:04.778
But the Jiao Tong Pavilion
has various people.

00:35:04.992 --> 00:35:06.432
Can't tell if the ones around him

00:35:06.432 --> 00:35:07.378
are evil or not.

00:35:08.177 --> 00:35:09.698
Calm down.

00:35:09.778 --> 00:35:11.104
Huan Zong, don't worry.

00:35:11.104 --> 00:35:11.858
Think about it.

00:35:11.938 --> 00:35:12.858
The Jiao Tong Pavilion

00:35:13.056 --> 00:35:13.938
has run for years.

00:35:13.938 --> 00:35:15.584
If it were a den of evil,

00:35:15.584 --> 00:35:16.657
would've been discovered.

00:35:16.818 --> 00:35:17.577
Besides,

00:35:17.577 --> 00:35:18.720
a smart and clever girl

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.258
like me,

00:35:20.298 --> 00:35:21.632
will surely

00:35:21.632 --> 00:35:23.338
charm Jiao Tong

00:35:23.418 --> 00:35:25.137
and successfully become his disciple.

00:35:25.312 --> 00:35:26.577
Just wait for my good news.

00:35:26.752 --> 00:35:28.298
You can never be too cautious.

00:35:28.418 --> 00:35:29.977
Better safe than sorry.

00:35:30.912 --> 00:35:32.017
It'd be safe.

00:35:32.192 --> 00:35:33.378
Huan Zong, take a seat.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.177
Relax.

00:35:36.338 --> 00:35:37.298
I'll pour you some tea.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.760
(Zong)

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.688
(Why is this character)

00:35:46.688 --> 00:35:47.977
(written like this?)

00:35:48.097 --> 00:35:49.698
(I've seen it somewhere.)

00:35:50.097 --> 00:35:50.778
(Right.)

00:35:51.137 --> 00:35:52.738
(Zong)
(One character in the signature)

00:35:53.184 --> 00:35:54.818
(of Master Writer is written like this.)

00:35:55.097 --> 00:35:55.977
What's wrong?

00:35:57.632 --> 00:35:58.624
Huan Zong.

00:35:58.624 --> 00:36:00.338
This character 'Zong' is quite special.

00:36:00.378 --> 00:36:01.858
Is it the 'Zong' from Liuguang Sect?

00:36:02.258 --> 00:36:03.738
It's the 'Zong' from Huan Zong.

00:36:05.057 --> 00:36:06.778
Did you write this yourself?

00:36:08.577 --> 00:36:09.376
(I don't think)

00:36:09.376 --> 00:36:10.418
(Zong)
(there are many people)

00:36:10.592 --> 00:36:12.224
(who write the character like this.)

00:36:12.992 --> 00:36:14.208
(He even went to ask about)

00:36:14.208 --> 00:36:15.258
(Master Writer's books.)

00:36:15.418 --> 00:36:16.537
(Is he...?)

00:36:17.617 --> 00:36:18.497
(The plots)

00:36:18.688 --> 00:36:20.137
(from Master Writer's books)

00:36:20.416 --> 00:36:21.920
(do seem to relate to)

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.338
(what Luanfeng Peak has done.)

00:36:25.017 --> 00:36:26.338
By the way, Huan Zong.

00:36:26.537 --> 00:36:28.258
I need to meet Jiao Tong.

00:36:28.416 --> 00:36:29.056
But I can't just

00:36:29.056 --> 00:36:30.218
go empty-handed.

00:36:30.848 --> 00:36:31.616
Should I

00:36:31.616 --> 00:36:32.657
prepare a gift?

00:36:33.258 --> 00:36:34.457
What do you want to gift?

00:36:35.457 --> 00:36:36.378
Think about it.

00:36:36.577 --> 00:36:38.338
Music, chess, calligraphy, painting.

00:36:38.418 --> 00:36:40.097
These four arts are interconnected.

00:36:40.416 --> 00:36:42.097
Since your handwriting is so beautiful,

00:36:42.097 --> 00:36:43.008
Huan Zong,

00:36:43.008 --> 00:36:44.057
can you write

00:36:44.057 --> 00:36:45.258
a piece of calligraphy for me?

00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:47.617
You'd gift him my piece of calligraphy?

00:36:50.457 --> 00:36:51.418
Huan Zong.

00:36:52.258 --> 00:36:52.898
Have some tea.

00:37:00.738 --> 00:37:01.617
Take a look.

00:37:07.681 --> 00:37:09.057
(Miao)

00:37:09.057 --> 00:37:10.496
(This 'Miao' character)

00:37:10.496 --> 00:37:12.418
(is just like the one
written by Master Writer.)

00:37:13.218 --> 00:37:14.457
(Try some other characters.)

00:37:15.457 --> 00:37:16.298
Huan Zong.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.888
Just this one piece

00:37:17.888 --> 00:37:18.898
isn't enough.

00:37:18.977 --> 00:37:20.738
Why don't you write me some more?

00:37:20.818 --> 00:37:21.577
More?

00:37:22.577 --> 00:37:23.537
What to write?

00:37:25.218 --> 00:37:27.177
Carrying a qin,
walking around the green sand.

00:37:27.218 --> 00:37:29.017
Depicting the beautiful clouds
with a brush.

00:37:46.617 --> 00:37:47.497
How about this?

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:53.920
(Brush)

00:37:55.298 --> 00:37:56.657
You are Master Writer.

00:37:56.657 --> 00:37:59.360
This character is the same
as the one written by Master Writer.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.457
So as the 'Miao' character.

00:38:00.537 --> 00:38:02.617
Huan Zong, you are Master Writer,

00:38:02.778 --> 00:38:03.617
right?

00:38:06.368 --> 00:38:08.738
It seems it's getting dark.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.040
The Jiao Tong Pavilion is about to open.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.256
Take these and go to him.

00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:13.632
Take that as a gift too.

00:38:13.898 --> 00:38:15.392
Just gift him whatever you want.

00:38:15.392 --> 00:38:16.378
Let's go.

00:38:16.378 --> 00:38:16.992
Huan Zong,

00:38:16.992 --> 00:38:18.378
you are Master Writer, right?

00:38:18.378 --> 00:38:20.338
- Let's go.
- Tell me.

00:39:07.017 --> 00:39:08.457
Lin Hu's messenger talisman?

00:39:10.818 --> 00:39:11.617
(Young Master.)

00:39:11.818 --> 00:39:13.177
(I found something suspicious.)

00:39:13.664 --> 00:39:15.017
(I work in here.)

00:39:15.392 --> 00:39:16.898
(At first, I could only wash dishes.)

00:39:17.344 --> 00:39:18.496
(Later, a servant)

00:39:18.496 --> 00:39:19.298
(got stomachache,)

00:39:19.298 --> 00:39:19.968
(so I...)

00:39:27.738 --> 00:39:28.497
