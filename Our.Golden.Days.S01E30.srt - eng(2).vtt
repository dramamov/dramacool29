00:00:01.289 --> 00:00:02.289
(Episode 30)

00:00:02.359 --> 00:00:03.529
But still...

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:06.499
If you save your brother,

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:10.229
the three of us can make up for all the lost time.

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.069
Let's live together.

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:15.099
What else matters?

00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:18.309
I'll walk away from everything.

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:21.979
Come live with me, Eun Oh.

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:29.749
What...

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:32.189
What are you talking about?

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:37.089
All that matters are the two children I gave birth to.

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:41.459
I don't need anything else.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.469
I'll make you seaweed soup on your real birthday,

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:49.169
and we can talk about everything we missed.

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.209
Let's live as a real family. Just the three of us, Eun Oh.

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:56.509
I'm...

00:00:59.349 --> 00:01:00.579
getting a divorce.

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:03.489
No, Mother. You can't.

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:12.199
"Mother?"

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:17.429
Please don't do this. Absolutely not.

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:20.699
If my mom finds out I found my birth mother,

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.939
she'll be completely devastated.

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.179
Besides, your family is innocent in all of this.

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:33.719
But you haven't done anything wrong either.

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.319
You're not to blame either.

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:41.489
It's just...

00:01:43.089 --> 00:01:44.989
this is how our fate turned out.

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:50.699
I'll do the liver transplant.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.169
I'll save my brother. So...

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:57.409
Please, don't even think about it.

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:02.379
I can't believe...

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:06.219
my daughter is such a wonderful person.

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:15.059
You should go inside...

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:16.889
before you catch a cold.

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:19.659
It's getting very late.

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:22.469
Please, hurry and go in.

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.269
We can...

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:31.869
talk more tomorrow.

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.059
I'll do the liver transplant.

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:52.529
I'll save my brother.

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:57.199
How am I going to tell Mom?

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.379
You have so much on your mind, don't you, Eun Oh?

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:10.749
She must've learned her real birthday...

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:12.019
from her birth mother.

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:21.359
But when on earth is she going to tell me?

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:23.859
Does she plan to hide it forever?

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.039
She stepped out at 11:45pm and got home...

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:07.599
at 1:55am.

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.179
What could she have been doing for 2 hours and 10 minutes?

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:17.579
She didn't even take her car today.

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:21.749
She just threw a coat on over her pyjamas.

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.389
Why is Mom acting so shady?

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.729
Why can't I fall asleep?

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.599
Even if I get caught, I won't say I spent the night with you.

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:43.309
I wouldn't tell them if my life depended on it.

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:44.609
So don't you worry.

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:49.009
Since we ended things on a bad note,

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:51.779
I can't get her out of my head.

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:56.949
She'll be all right, won't she?

00:04:58.019 --> 00:04:59.189
She'll be fine, right?

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:11.569
About that blind date you mentioned the other day...

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.239
Right.

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.199
They're waiting for an answer.

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:17.409
Seong Jae, what should I tell them?

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:19.839
Should I tell them you're not interested?

00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:21.239
I'll meet her.

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:24.349
You will?

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.679
The young lady was very attractive.

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:30.289
I guess you liked what you saw.

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.189
If Seong Jae gets married,

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:35.459
that means I'll have to wait my turn.

00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:40.329
You're going on the blind date? Are you getting married?

00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:42.569
This is so exciting!

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:45.469
Don't jinx it.

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:50.239
Don't count your chickens yet. It's bad luck.

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:53.279
Your mom is right, Yeong Ra.

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:56.509
We don't want to jinx things for your brother.

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:58.349
It must've taken a lot for him to make that decision.

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:04.719
I got the Vice President position, so now I have to go on blind dates.

00:06:06.359 --> 00:06:09.259
- No real ceremony for the new CEO? - I hear he's just sending a video.

00:06:09.329 --> 00:06:10.459
He's not even inviting reporters.

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:12.599
Is he trying to keep his distance so he can restructure?

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:16.429
- Oh, this must be it. - Hello. I am Lee Ji Hyuk,

00:06:16.429 --> 00:06:17.529
the new CEO of AP Group.

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:21.069
First, I'd like to apologise for addressing you through a screen.

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:24.639
I consider myself very fortunate with this acquisition.

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:29.009
That's why I believe that what's most important right now,

00:06:29.209 --> 00:06:33.049
more than any formal inauguration, is understanding AP Group first.

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:35.689
The company's structure, its products,

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:38.419
and the technological advancements you all have cultivated...

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:40.059
These are things I must fully understand.

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:43.529
There's one thing I learned from my matching platform.

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:46.559
That quality materials and a trustworthy system...

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:49.099
must be at the heart of the interior design market.

00:06:49.929 --> 00:06:52.199
Going forward, I want to make this company...

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:56.669
to be one that sets the standard in interior design for customers.

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:58.439
A company that is more creative...

00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:01.179
and more customer-focused than ever before.

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:04.749
Together with all of you who have been so devoted to AP,

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:07.279
let's build a new future for the company.

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:09.589
- Oh, nice. - Wow, amazing!

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:10.719
He's keeping all of us!

00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:12.359
This is amazing.

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:15.759
- What a relief. - Ji Hyuk is so cool, right?

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:19.129
- He's just like he was in college. - Yes.

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:28.439
What did you think? Did I seem like a decent CEO?

00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:31.039
Do you think the employees will trust me?

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:35.339
For starters, guaranteeing everyone's jobs was a smart move.

00:07:35.709 --> 00:07:38.079
- Congratulations. - Yes!

00:07:39.249 --> 00:07:40.849
I look forward to working with you all.

00:07:45.619 --> 00:07:47.159
- Mom. - Yes?

00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:48.989
What are you doing? Aren't you going to the restaurant?

00:07:49.059 --> 00:07:52.259
Why don't you go ahead and open up today?

00:07:52.329 --> 00:07:54.429
I have to catch up on some laundry, then I'll head over.

00:07:55.429 --> 00:07:57.299
If you have anything for the dry cleaner, leave it out.

00:07:57.669 --> 00:07:58.669
Got it.

00:08:02.339 --> 00:08:03.409
All right.

00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:06.879
Dry-clean... Wash this one.

00:08:08.579 --> 00:08:10.879
Gosh. She left this here and then will ask me where it is.

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:12.319
What's this?

(Post-Liver Transplant Test Instructions)

00:08:27.229 --> 00:08:29.969
The hospital keeps calling to rush us,

00:08:30.729 --> 00:08:32.839
so can you stop by for a bit today?

00:08:33.499 --> 00:08:35.769
If you're busy, I can come to your office.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:43.079
I'm on my way now.

(Director Ko Seong Hui)

00:08:53.589 --> 00:08:55.159
Get a grip, Jeong Sun Hui.

00:08:56.229 --> 00:08:57.589
You have to protect Eun Oh.

00:08:59.099 --> 00:09:00.329
Thanks to your husband,

00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:03.629
you lived like a princess.

00:09:04.769 --> 00:09:06.069
After he died,

00:09:06.369 --> 00:09:09.039
you started relying on Eun Oh as if she were your husband.

00:09:10.509 --> 00:09:13.209
That's your Eun Oh. Your daughter.

00:09:14.209 --> 00:09:16.179
Eun Oh.

00:09:19.419 --> 00:09:20.649
You have to protect her.

00:09:27.919 --> 00:09:31.829
You don't even want your mother to know you're meeting with me.

00:09:32.699 --> 00:09:36.029
If that's the case, there's no way you can tell her about the surgery.

00:09:37.399 --> 00:09:39.769
That's why I was thinking of telling my mom...

00:09:39.899 --> 00:09:43.039
I'm going on a trip to Europe with a friend.

00:09:43.139 --> 00:09:44.909
You think she'll believe that?

00:09:46.139 --> 00:09:47.139
What?

00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:49.649
Would someone as responsible as you...

00:09:50.009 --> 00:09:52.949
really take 3 or 4 weeks off from work for a vacation?

00:09:56.549 --> 00:09:59.819
Besides, I'd have to send her pictures from there and everything,

00:10:00.119 --> 00:10:01.759
so I realised it wouldn't work.

00:10:04.129 --> 00:10:07.629
I've been giving it some thought,

00:10:08.299 --> 00:10:09.629
and the New York School...

00:10:09.629 --> 00:10:11.799
has a short-term interior design program.

00:10:12.199 --> 00:10:15.599
That would be a believable excuse, don't you think?

00:10:18.909 --> 00:10:20.279
You're right. That could work.

00:10:22.309 --> 00:10:25.249
There are tons of photos with New York in the background,

00:10:25.979 --> 00:10:27.919
and technology is so good these days.

00:10:28.749 --> 00:10:31.189
Apparently, it's not that hard to manipulate images.

00:10:33.659 --> 00:10:34.819
Really?

00:10:36.659 --> 00:10:37.659
What a relief.

00:10:38.359 --> 00:10:41.029
That'll put Mom at ease.

00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:45.099
Then...

00:10:46.499 --> 00:10:48.099
about the surgery...

00:10:49.039 --> 00:10:51.209
Can I go ahead and schedule it?

00:10:55.409 --> 00:10:56.409
Yes.

- How can I help you, ma'am? - Get out of my way.

00:11:35.319 --> 00:11:36.519
You can't go in there!

00:11:45.089 --> 00:11:46.099
You witch!

00:11:46.529 --> 00:11:48.259
How dare you go after my daughter? My daughter!

00:11:48.329 --> 00:11:50.329
- Please, you can't do this! - My daughter!

00:11:50.329 --> 00:11:52.299
- Ma'am! Please! - You witch!

00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:53.699
- How dare you go after my daughter? - Ma'am!

You witch!

00:11:57.069 --> 00:11:58.069
You...

00:11:58.369 --> 00:12:01.839
You came for Eun Oh's liver, right? That's why you tracked her down!

00:12:02.479 --> 00:12:04.349
Who do you think you are, to dare mess with my daughter?

00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:07.019
You despicable witch.

00:12:25.099 --> 00:12:26.269
Are you finished?

00:12:27.339 --> 00:12:28.499
Then please leave.

00:12:33.879 --> 00:12:37.049
- Should I call the police? - Go ahead!

00:12:38.079 --> 00:12:41.119
I'll report that a brazen thief showed up after 25 years.

00:12:42.379 --> 00:12:44.819
I clearly heard that...

00:12:45.119 --> 00:12:47.959
Eun Oh was abandoned. You abandoned your own child.

00:12:48.889 --> 00:12:52.959
I'm sure you spun a plausible story for Eun Oh. You may have fooled her,

00:12:53.029 --> 00:12:57.199
but you can't fool me. Got it? You only came back for her liver.

00:12:57.599 --> 00:13:00.599
But now that I know, don't even dream about it.

00:13:01.169 --> 00:13:02.909
You will never lay a hand on my daughter.

00:13:03.739 --> 00:13:07.139
As for a liver, find another donor or figure something else out.

00:13:07.609 --> 00:13:09.309
Just stay away from Eun Oh.

00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:13.179
You won't take my daughter's liver. Do you understand?

00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:24.859
If you've said your piece, you should leave.

00:13:25.999 --> 00:13:28.859
No, I'm not leaving until I get an answer!

00:13:31.899 --> 00:13:34.869
You're sure I abandoned my daughter, aren't you?

00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:36.769
I am!

00:13:37.709 --> 00:13:40.939
And if Eun Oh finds out that I know,

00:13:41.079 --> 00:13:44.849
she'll never go through with the transplant. You hear me?

00:13:44.909 --> 00:13:48.019
I'll stop her no matter what. Don't think I won't.

00:13:48.719 --> 00:13:51.449
What do you even know about Eun Oh?

00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:54.959
Do you know her like I do? I raised her for 26 years!

00:13:56.029 --> 00:13:59.699
I know my daughter best, and I'll protect her!

00:14:05.969 --> 00:14:09.139
So get lost before you hurt Eun Oh any more.

00:14:09.199 --> 00:14:11.909
You absolute monster!

00:14:15.079 --> 00:14:16.209
You witch.

00:14:37.869 --> 00:14:39.669
A leave of absence? For a whole month?

00:14:41.169 --> 00:14:43.969
Yes. A university in New York offers...

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:46.939
a short-term interior design program.

00:14:49.809 --> 00:14:51.179
So you've decided on the liver transplant.

00:14:54.349 --> 00:14:56.319
I'm requesting a one-month leave of absence.

00:14:56.589 --> 00:14:58.419
I just need your decision on that request.

00:14:58.489 --> 00:14:59.619
Absolutely not.

00:15:00.619 --> 00:15:01.719
No!

00:15:02.219 --> 00:15:04.559
The head of the turnkey team will just disappear for a month?

00:15:05.959 --> 00:15:10.199
I'm in a partnership with you. I'm not asking for your permission.

00:15:12.499 --> 00:15:13.499
Eun Oh.

00:15:17.109 --> 00:15:20.239
You really can't do this. This is just wrong.

00:15:21.139 --> 00:15:23.749
I've said what I needed to. I'll see myself out.

00:15:25.609 --> 00:15:26.619
Ji Eun Oh!

00:15:31.489 --> 00:15:33.019
She's so stubborn. What am I supposed to do?

00:15:35.089 --> 00:15:36.089
General Manager,

00:15:36.089 --> 00:15:39.129
I need about three weeks off for a personal matter,

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:43.429
starting in two weeks. I'll organise my pending tasks...

00:15:43.599 --> 00:15:45.029
and send you the list.

00:15:49.139 --> 00:15:50.139
Yes.

00:15:56.279 --> 00:16:00.479
Don't tell me... Did Ji Hyuk send you?

00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:02.949
Even if Ji Hyuk hadn't said anything,

00:16:03.219 --> 00:16:04.889
I would've come on my own. I was curious.

00:16:06.589 --> 00:16:08.789
Please, have a seat.

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:15.129
Do you also think this connection with my birth mother...

00:16:15.329 --> 00:16:18.229
could have been deliberately set up?

00:16:20.699 --> 00:16:22.769
It is awfully coincidental.

00:16:23.209 --> 00:16:26.379
I'm talking about the coincidences between you and your birth mother.

00:16:27.109 --> 00:16:28.279
Exactly.

00:16:28.939 --> 00:16:32.349
I met her under circumstances...

00:16:32.479 --> 00:16:34.249
that were impossible to stage.

00:16:36.189 --> 00:16:39.759
So I saw that desperate, heart-wrenching motherly love.

00:16:40.459 --> 00:16:42.119
And I saw her true character.

00:16:44.559 --> 00:16:47.229
I saw her in a situation that she could have never faked.

00:16:48.059 --> 00:16:49.529
And yet, Ji Hyuk...

00:16:49.969 --> 00:16:53.199
keeps stressing me out over some baseless gut feeling.

00:16:54.469 --> 00:16:59.139
I see your point, but I've heard almost the exact same thing before.

00:16:59.269 --> 00:17:00.479
But the thing is,

00:17:01.109 --> 00:17:03.309
the person in my case didn't give off a good vibe.

00:17:04.409 --> 00:17:06.109
Who was it?

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:10.689
Just someone. Anyway, both Ji Hyuk and I...

00:17:10.749 --> 00:17:12.589
We're just worried about you, Eun Oh.

00:17:13.489 --> 00:17:14.889
We just hope you'll be careful.

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:27.499
How did it go?

00:17:29.039 --> 00:17:30.109
No luck.

00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:33.609
Is she really dead set on the liver transplant?

00:17:34.139 --> 00:17:35.839
She's so naive, isn't she?

00:17:36.249 --> 00:17:37.249
But listen, Ji Hyuk.

00:17:37.779 --> 00:17:41.619
Eun Oh could be right. But your suspicions are reasonable.

00:17:41.749 --> 00:17:45.219
- They're more than reasonable. - Right, but we have no proof.

00:17:45.589 --> 00:17:48.459
It could be your feelings for Eun Oh making you this anxious.

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:50.329
Proof?

00:17:50.659 --> 00:17:53.359
In any case, the Eun Oh we know...

00:17:53.929 --> 00:17:56.229
She's not the type to just stand by and let someone die.

00:17:56.869 --> 00:17:58.799
Besides, even though she met her as a client,

00:17:59.569 --> 00:18:01.339
they already seem to have a strong connection.

00:18:01.839 --> 00:18:03.469
This isn't some stranger who happens to be her birth mother.

00:18:04.309 --> 00:18:05.309
Connection?

00:18:09.439 --> 00:18:10.779
I'm home.

00:18:14.579 --> 00:18:16.349
Making bean sprout soup for breakfast tomorrow?

00:18:18.689 --> 00:18:19.689
Eun Oh.

00:18:21.089 --> 00:18:22.859
Don't you have something to tell me?

00:18:24.329 --> 00:18:25.429
Like what?

00:18:26.529 --> 00:18:28.299
You look like you have something on your mind.

00:18:31.529 --> 00:18:33.099
Actually, I do.

00:18:35.199 --> 00:18:36.469
Is she finally going to tell me?

00:18:38.709 --> 00:18:39.709
Mom, I...

00:18:40.609 --> 00:18:41.939
In about two weeks,

00:18:42.379 --> 00:18:45.179
I'm going to New York for a short interior design program.

00:18:45.379 --> 00:18:46.779
For about a month?

00:18:48.379 --> 00:18:50.289
Or are you going to give someone a liver transplant?

00:18:52.819 --> 00:18:54.819
How could you, without a word to me,

00:18:55.219 --> 00:18:57.729
even think of doing something this major?

00:18:58.589 --> 00:19:01.429
Now that you've found your rich mom, do I mean nothing to you?

00:19:03.169 --> 00:19:06.599
- Mom, how can you say that? - Then what am I supposed to say?

00:19:07.169 --> 00:19:10.669
You secretly met your birth mother and planned a liver transplant.

00:19:11.769 --> 00:19:14.109
If you really thought of me as your mother,

00:19:14.409 --> 00:19:16.109
you could never do this to me.

00:19:17.849 --> 00:19:18.879
Mom...

00:19:19.849 --> 00:19:23.019
- How did you find out? - Don't you even think about it!

00:19:24.749 --> 00:19:26.619
How could you do this to me?

00:19:27.319 --> 00:19:30.889
So you wanted to see your birth mom. How did you hold it in for so long?

00:19:33.529 --> 00:19:37.529
Mom, it's not like that. That's not what it was at all.

00:19:38.129 --> 00:19:40.539
Someone suggested...

00:19:41.069 --> 00:19:44.409
that maybe I wasn't abandoned, but was just a lost child.

00:19:44.939 --> 00:19:48.839
That whoever found me might've taken me to the orphanage.

00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:53.619
If so, my birth parents must've spent their lives in agony.

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:58.319
- I wanted to be sure. That's all. - Who?

00:19:58.749 --> 00:20:00.919
Who told you something like that?

00:20:01.359 --> 00:20:03.929
Have you been telling every person you meet that you're adopted?

00:20:04.059 --> 00:20:06.699
Is that how you've been living? No wonder you'd hear such things.

00:20:12.469 --> 00:20:13.469
Eun Oh...

00:20:15.539 --> 00:20:16.969
You really have been, haven't you?

00:20:19.069 --> 00:20:22.779
Always thinking of yourself as the adopted daughter...

00:20:23.479 --> 00:20:25.049
and of us as your adoptive parents.

00:20:27.749 --> 00:20:28.979
No, Mom.

00:20:29.889 --> 00:20:31.719
That's not what I meant at all.

00:20:32.919 --> 00:20:34.989
Then why did you register your DNA?

00:20:38.389 --> 00:20:39.759
Eun Oh, how could you?

00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:44.769
You said you were my sister. You said we were a family, period.

00:20:46.569 --> 00:20:48.069
Then why are you looking for your blood relatives?

00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:52.509
Why do you care if you were abandoned or got lost?

00:20:53.309 --> 00:20:55.839
Mom's your mom, and you're her daughter.

00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:56.909
That's all that should matter.

00:21:00.279 --> 00:21:03.349
Mom, this is exactly what I meant about prioritizing blood ties.

00:21:07.189 --> 00:21:08.619
You're unbelievable.

00:21:09.519 --> 00:21:10.989
Wasn't finding your birth family enough for you?

00:21:11.829 --> 00:21:15.429
- You'd even do a liver transplant? - No, you can't.

00:21:16.199 --> 00:21:17.299
I won't let you.

00:21:17.929 --> 00:21:21.969
Eun Oh, mark my words. You are not doing it.

00:21:25.109 --> 00:21:26.109
Both of you...

00:21:27.639 --> 00:21:29.909
Can't you at least try to see things from my perspective?

00:21:30.649 --> 00:21:32.649
No. This isn't happening.

00:21:33.649 --> 00:21:35.479
If you go through with the liver transplant,

00:21:35.479 --> 00:21:36.889
then we're done.

00:21:38.949 --> 00:21:40.819
Mom, how can you say something like that?

00:21:40.889 --> 00:21:43.329
You're the one making that choice right now!

00:21:50.369 --> 00:21:51.569
Hey, where are you going?

00:21:53.299 --> 00:21:54.869
I left something I need for work back at the office.

00:22:21.459 --> 00:22:22.729
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:22:26.099 --> 00:22:29.739
But when you say things like that, what am I supposed to do?

00:22:40.649 --> 00:22:43.319
(CEO's Office)

00:22:48.689 --> 00:22:51.129
(Team Leader's Office)

00:23:13.319 --> 00:23:15.179
Why did you come in without asking?

00:23:16.349 --> 00:23:19.649
I wasn't asking for permission. I had to check on you.

00:23:20.089 --> 00:23:23.959
Because you're at your desk so late with nothing on it?

00:23:27.099 --> 00:23:28.129
Please leave.

00:23:33.999 --> 00:23:34.999
Don't do it.

00:23:44.209 --> 00:23:47.819
I've been thinking about it, and there are some red flags.

00:23:48.779 --> 00:23:51.119
That art space she commissioned...

00:23:51.789 --> 00:23:53.919
It's been months, and construction hasn't even started yet.

00:23:54.619 --> 00:23:57.559
Shouldn't it have been finished by now?

00:23:57.929 --> 00:24:00.129
That was delayed because of a leak.

00:24:01.129 --> 00:24:02.399
Is the leak fixed?

00:24:02.929 --> 00:24:04.669
So when does the interior work start?

00:24:09.399 --> 00:24:10.469
Lately...

00:24:11.069 --> 00:24:14.879
- I had no time for the project. - What about before the leak?

00:24:15.609 --> 00:24:16.779
You got the commission in the spring.

00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:20.379
And she's been getting close to you all this time.

00:24:25.289 --> 00:24:27.589
Wow, you're really good at forcing the pieces to fit.

00:24:28.089 --> 00:24:31.029
Do you think this is some kind of puzzle game?

00:24:38.029 --> 00:24:39.029
Eun Oh.

00:24:40.199 --> 00:24:43.669
I just want you to be more careful.

00:24:45.109 --> 00:24:49.139
Whether someone lives or dies isn't necessarily in your hands.

00:24:54.949 --> 00:24:56.919
It's easy for you to say because you're not involved.

00:24:59.449 --> 00:25:00.889
Your birth mother who appeared out of nowhere...

00:25:01.659 --> 00:25:02.889
and the sense of responsibility that comes with it...

00:25:04.189 --> 00:25:05.289
Because of all that,

00:25:06.629 --> 00:25:09.729
don't take going under the knife so lightly.

00:25:10.569 --> 00:25:11.569
I'm asking you, please.

00:25:15.769 --> 00:25:17.209
I want to be alone.

00:25:22.409 --> 00:25:23.409
Okay.

Welcome.

I said, sit down, Jeong Sun Hui.

I'm here to tell you something you need to hear.

00:26:21.699 --> 00:26:24.709
Eun Oh will go through with her brother's liver transplant.

00:26:25.809 --> 00:26:27.079
So don't you dare try anything.

00:26:27.409 --> 00:26:28.439
What did you say?

00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:32.749
- What did you just say to me? - Don't start fights like yesterday.

00:26:34.579 --> 00:26:36.019
You're insane.

00:26:37.389 --> 00:26:39.649
And how are you going to stop Eun Oh from doing the liver transplant?

00:26:40.259 --> 00:26:41.389
Do you even have a plan?

00:26:42.289 --> 00:26:45.029
Get angry? Cry? Beg?

Appeal to pity?

You know what all that is?

You're just telling Eun Oh to kill her brother. To let him die.

00:26:55.599 --> 00:26:56.639
That's emotional blackmail.

00:26:58.909 --> 00:27:00.639
You raised her, so you know, don't you?

00:27:01.379 --> 00:27:02.809
How fragile and kind Eun Oh is.

00:27:04.209 --> 00:27:05.479
I can just see it now.

00:27:06.049 --> 00:27:08.619
You'd put a knife to your own throat in front of her to stop it.

00:27:09.449 --> 00:27:11.149
And she might just give in to that.

00:27:12.219 --> 00:27:14.089
And then her brother would die, wouldn't he?

00:27:15.559 --> 00:27:19.929
Twist your logic all you want. I'm not buying it.

00:27:22.129 --> 00:27:24.999
Do you still think I came here for your permission?

00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:27.939
I am asking if you can handle the consequences.

00:27:29.339 --> 00:27:31.409
If my son doesn't get the transplant, he will die.

00:27:32.139 --> 00:27:34.309
Then, whenever I see Eun Oh,

00:27:34.309 --> 00:27:36.979
I'll cry for the brother she let die.

00:27:38.379 --> 00:27:41.449
And then, Eun Oh will come home, look at you, and think,

00:27:44.849 --> 00:27:47.789
"It's because of her that I let my brother die."

00:27:48.219 --> 00:27:51.429
Stop talking nonsense and get out. That will never happen!

00:27:52.329 --> 00:27:53.329
And why not?

00:27:53.999 --> 00:27:56.829
Because you raised her for 20 years, you think you're her real mother?

00:27:57.829 --> 00:28:00.369
I am her birth mother.

00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:02.899
How long do you think it'll take for that blood tie...

00:28:02.899 --> 00:28:04.109
to matter more?

00:28:06.069 --> 00:28:07.479
A few years?

00:28:09.079 --> 00:28:11.449
Do you even know where Eun Oh and I stand right now?

00:28:12.479 --> 00:28:14.819
You abandoned her. What tie are you even talking about?

00:28:15.379 --> 00:28:16.989
Gosh, just get out!

00:28:17.589 --> 00:28:20.919
Get out of my restaurant, or I'll call the police! My gosh!

00:28:21.319 --> 00:28:22.459
This restaurant?

00:28:23.589 --> 00:28:25.659
Eun Oh set this up for you, didn't she?

00:28:27.229 --> 00:28:30.769
You were just a useless mother mooching off your husband.

00:28:30.999 --> 00:28:34.569
You made Eun Oh work part-time jobs. Her dream was interior design,

00:28:34.639 --> 00:28:37.639
but you made her get a corporate job to open this restaurant for you.

00:28:37.709 --> 00:28:38.969
You have the nerve to call yourself a mother?

00:28:41.009 --> 00:28:42.439
What if it were your son?

00:28:43.239 --> 00:28:46.879
If your son needed a new liver, would you stop Eun Oh from donating?

00:28:49.819 --> 00:28:53.149
Could you just stand there and watch your own son die?

00:28:53.719 --> 00:28:57.629
Would you worry about your pride or acting proper in that situation?

00:28:58.229 --> 00:29:01.699
What mother lets her own son die? Could you do it? Answer me!

00:29:04.769 --> 00:29:05.769
I...

00:29:07.339 --> 00:29:08.939
will never let my son die.

00:29:11.139 --> 00:29:13.809
I'd cut her open while she's alive if I had to.

00:29:19.179 --> 00:29:20.219
Ji Eun Oh.

00:29:20.749 --> 00:29:23.549
If you want to keep her as your daughter,

00:29:24.419 --> 00:29:26.889
then let her make her own choice.

00:29:27.659 --> 00:29:28.989
Stay out of it.

00:29:36.629 --> 00:29:37.799
I'm glad we reached an understanding.

00:29:38.229 --> 00:29:39.429
It has put my mind at ease.

00:29:48.509 --> 00:29:49.509
Oh, gosh. What am I going to do?

00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:54.149
What am I going to do?

00:29:54.679 --> 00:29:56.279
(Handover Materials for Team Leader Jo Gyeong Su)

00:29:59.349 --> 00:30:00.719
Is the leak fixed?

00:30:01.019 --> 00:30:02.789
So when does the interior work start?

00:30:05.659 --> 00:30:07.199
Back then, I really...

00:30:07.699 --> 00:30:10.299
never heard what happened with the leak repair.

00:30:13.069 --> 00:30:14.069
That's right.

00:30:14.499 --> 00:30:16.539
She must have been busy with the liver transplant.

00:30:21.279 --> 00:30:23.979
But thankfully, we found a donor and scheduled the surgery.

00:30:26.479 --> 00:30:27.679
Wait, no.

00:30:28.379 --> 00:30:29.419
Back then,

00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:32.389
they already had a donor for the transplant.

(Neiro Webtoon Manager)

00:30:41.159 --> 00:30:42.359
This is driving me crazy.

00:30:44.799 --> 00:30:46.699
You said you'd take a day to think about it.

00:30:47.069 --> 00:30:50.339
- Neiro won't stop calling me. - Ji Wan, look.

00:30:51.209 --> 00:30:52.569
Mom's in Yangpyeong again.

00:30:52.869 --> 00:30:53.879
Again?

00:30:55.709 --> 00:30:58.679
You're right. Hey, isn't that the same place as before?

00:31:00.049 --> 00:31:03.689
Hey, can you follow her in real time by watching the GPS tracker?

00:31:03.849 --> 00:31:06.119
I should be able to follow closely.

00:31:06.119 --> 00:31:08.119
The map shows the roads like a navigation app.

00:31:09.359 --> 00:31:11.629
So when Mom heads back to Seoul today,

00:31:11.889 --> 00:31:14.459
- we could catch her, then? - Hey, what are you talking about?

00:31:16.499 --> 00:31:17.729
You want us to tail her?

00:31:25.539 --> 00:31:28.109
I'll go give him the scarf so I can see him.

00:31:28.939 --> 00:31:30.379
I was supposed to give it to him anyway.

00:31:33.749 --> 00:31:35.519
But once I give him the scarf,

00:31:36.249 --> 00:31:38.289
I won't have an excuse to go see him anymore.

00:31:48.659 --> 00:31:52.169
Su Bin, come here for a second.

00:31:53.569 --> 00:31:54.569
Okay.

00:31:55.899 --> 00:32:00.739
I wore this dress and snuck out in Mom's high heels,

00:32:00.809 --> 00:32:02.479
and went all the way into town.

00:32:02.479 --> 00:32:05.079
That person left another comment.

00:32:05.379 --> 00:32:06.379
What do I do about this?

00:32:06.879 --> 00:32:07.879
A comment?

00:32:08.719 --> 00:32:11.119
Hello, I'm the VP of the Senior Model Association.

00:32:11.119 --> 00:32:13.349
I left a comment before.

00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:16.819
If you'd like to be a senior model, please contact me at this number.

00:32:18.129 --> 00:32:19.429
A senior model.

00:32:19.929 --> 00:32:23.729
Is this for real? Are they going to make me a model?

00:32:24.499 --> 00:32:28.139
I doubt it. A lot of scams target the elderly,

00:32:28.199 --> 00:32:29.439
so you have to be careful.

00:32:30.509 --> 00:32:34.479
- Grandma, do you want to model? - Of course not.

00:32:34.639 --> 00:32:37.279
A model, at my age? Don't be ridiculous.

00:32:38.479 --> 00:32:39.649
What?

00:32:40.179 --> 00:32:41.819
This yarn of yours.

00:32:42.249 --> 00:32:44.289
How long are you going to carry it around?

00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:47.989
You're always fiddling with it. Why aren't you done knitting it yet?

00:32:48.659 --> 00:32:52.129
- I'll finish it. Give it here. - No, you can't, Grandma!

00:32:53.589 --> 00:32:56.499
Hey. Why are you getting so upset?

00:32:56.699 --> 00:32:58.169
Are you worried Grandma will mess it up?

00:32:59.069 --> 00:33:00.199
No.

00:33:03.199 --> 00:33:05.909
It's just that when I finish this, I have to give it to someone.

00:33:07.239 --> 00:33:09.079
But once I give it to him, it's over.

00:33:10.039 --> 00:33:13.609
But if I take my time, I still have a reason to see him.

00:33:14.779 --> 00:33:18.519
So you're using that yarn to hold onto him.

00:33:19.449 --> 00:33:21.689
Who is this guy? Who is he?

00:33:22.519 --> 00:33:25.989
No, that's not it. I was just thinking... Yes.

00:33:26.129 --> 00:33:27.229
I was just imagining things.

00:33:38.739 --> 00:33:40.679
Hello, Jang Su.

00:33:44.279 --> 00:33:45.409
Where are you?

00:33:46.509 --> 00:33:48.079
A senior model?

00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:52.449
Seeing you on Su Bin's YouTube channel and all...

00:33:52.649 --> 00:33:56.759
I heard you wanted to be an actress when you were younger, right?

00:33:57.359 --> 00:34:00.229
The way I see it, Ok Rye, you've got a talent for it.

00:34:00.359 --> 00:34:02.529
You should give being a senior model a try.

00:34:02.599 --> 00:34:05.669
Please, don't be ridiculous.

00:34:06.029 --> 00:34:09.099
- I'm not doing it. Of course not. - Hey, but what about the future?

00:34:09.569 --> 00:34:11.739
What are you going to do if you live for another ten years?

00:34:12.539 --> 00:34:13.539
What?

00:34:13.539 --> 00:34:16.909
Remember how miserable we were, not knowing how much time was left?

00:34:17.609 --> 00:34:21.449
We're less able, but still healthy, and life has gotten boring.

00:34:21.549 --> 00:34:25.289
The future feels so long and empty, you know? That's why,

00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:27.159
when an opportunity comes, you have to grab whatever it is.

00:34:28.419 --> 00:34:32.789
Do you think a chance like this will ever come again?

00:34:33.029 --> 00:34:34.129
As you're approaching 100?

(Age Is Just a Number: Senior Model)

00:34:43.169 --> 00:34:44.639
I saw you on YouTube.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:47.039
- You're so cool. - How embarrassing.

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:50.949
The comment was left by the VP of the Senior Model Association.

00:34:51.249 --> 00:34:52.509
Really?

00:34:52.649 --> 00:34:56.419
If you start taking classes here, the VP will visit you.

00:34:56.549 --> 00:34:57.889
- Really? - Yes.

00:34:58.589 --> 00:35:00.859
Oh, dear. What should I do then?

00:35:01.989 --> 00:35:04.429
Since this is an academy, I'll have to pay, won't I?

00:35:05.689 --> 00:35:10.529
I paid for your first month. It's my last gift before I leave.

00:35:10.529 --> 00:35:13.599
Oh, no, you shouldn't have. I can't accept this. My goodness.

00:35:13.669 --> 00:35:17.769
I need to see you settled in to leave with peace of mind.

00:35:17.909 --> 00:35:19.439
So, not another word.

00:35:20.939 --> 00:35:22.779
My, you're so intimidating.

00:35:23.809 --> 00:35:25.209
All right.

00:35:25.909 --> 00:35:29.049
You're scaring me, so I guess I have to do as I'm told.

00:35:36.189 --> 00:35:38.659
Su Bin, I'm here.

00:35:45.069 --> 00:35:46.529
Seriously,

00:35:47.129 --> 00:35:49.769
even for you, wasn't going for it three times a bit much?

00:35:50.369 --> 00:35:52.109
You might as well have asked him out ten times.

00:35:53.979 --> 00:35:56.739
That's not it. I knew what I was getting into.

00:35:57.479 --> 00:36:00.779
I knew he wasn't going to like me anyway.

00:36:01.079 --> 00:36:04.189
I knew he had no feelings for me and never would.

00:36:05.219 --> 00:36:07.659
That's why I only asked for three dates.

00:36:08.689 --> 00:36:11.889
Why bother asking for three dates if you knew you'd get shot down?

00:36:12.659 --> 00:36:15.029
I wanted to see him, even if it was just three times.

00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:18.569
I wanted to at least have some memories with Seong Jae.

00:36:19.029 --> 00:36:20.329
Gosh, Su Bin.

00:36:20.939 --> 00:36:25.209
When you act like a tragic heroine, I'm at a total loss.

00:36:26.109 --> 00:36:27.379
I miss him.

00:36:28.079 --> 00:36:30.779
But I really miss him and can't stop thinking about him, Ha Eun.

00:36:32.809 --> 00:36:36.149
This is a first. I honestly don't know what to say.

00:36:36.379 --> 00:36:37.849
Just don't say anything.

00:36:38.819 --> 00:36:40.189
It's no use.

00:36:42.619 --> 00:36:46.089
Now, if I just put a scarf right here...

00:36:50.429 --> 00:36:51.429
(Camping, Su Bin)

00:37:03.139 --> 00:37:04.249
Sir.

00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:10.379
You have your 4pm meeting in Cheongdam-dong.

00:37:11.219 --> 00:37:12.689
You need to leave now.

00:37:13.819 --> 00:37:16.119
- Right. Understood. - All right.

00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:26.699
As you probably already know,

00:37:27.329 --> 00:37:31.769
it's the family business, so I'm working my way to the top.

00:37:32.169 --> 00:37:35.009
Not much has changed since promotion from when I was the Chief Director.

00:37:36.879 --> 00:37:38.079
I see.

00:37:39.449 --> 00:37:41.349
That's really impressive.

00:37:42.879 --> 00:37:44.049
What is?

00:37:44.689 --> 00:37:46.919
Leading a company, of course.

00:37:49.759 --> 00:37:51.989
But I just told you I'm not the one leading it.

00:37:52.959 --> 00:37:54.729
But you will be.

00:37:54.999 --> 00:37:57.799
Just handling that kind of pressure is impressive enough.

00:37:59.599 --> 00:38:02.139
You're aware that I'm divorced, right?

00:38:02.769 --> 00:38:06.039
Yes, but I heard it was very brief.

00:38:08.109 --> 00:38:09.209
Six months?

00:38:11.079 --> 00:38:13.379
So being married is fine as long as it was only six months?

00:38:13.949 --> 00:38:15.119
It doesn't bother you?

00:38:17.649 --> 00:38:21.459
I heard your ex-wife was the one with all the problems.

00:38:24.559 --> 00:38:25.989
What kind of problems?

00:38:26.989 --> 00:38:28.099
She was only in it for the money.

00:38:29.029 --> 00:38:30.029
A classic gold digger?

00:38:39.039 --> 00:38:41.309
So that's the rumour going around.

00:38:42.009 --> 00:38:43.939
Since you were the one who was conned,

00:38:44.579 --> 00:38:46.349
I can look past something like that.

00:38:47.549 --> 00:38:48.719
How generous of you.

00:38:49.449 --> 00:38:50.949
What kind of food do you like?

00:38:50.949 --> 00:38:53.089
I know Western, Japanese, and French.

00:38:53.149 --> 00:38:54.719
I've taken cooking classes for all of them.

00:38:57.089 --> 00:38:58.459
I prefer Korean food.

00:39:05.429 --> 00:39:06.469
Yes, Mr. Park.

00:39:07.099 --> 00:39:09.899
I'm on my way to the head office. I need a favour.

00:39:10.809 --> 00:39:13.969
I noticed the report is missing last year's after-sales data.

00:39:14.339 --> 00:39:15.609
Could you look that up for me?

00:39:16.239 --> 00:39:17.239
Okay.

00:39:23.949 --> 00:39:24.949
What?

00:39:26.219 --> 00:39:28.259
What's Mom doing over there?

00:39:36.759 --> 00:39:38.199
(Director Ko)

00:39:40.669 --> 00:39:42.499
You don't have to stare so hard.

00:39:42.569 --> 00:39:45.539
I'm doing a fine job following Director Ko's car myself.

00:39:46.839 --> 00:39:47.839
It's because this is exciting.

00:39:48.639 --> 00:39:50.879
I didn't want to say it since it's about your mother,

00:39:51.709 --> 00:39:54.079
but I'm getting into it, too. I feel like a detective.

00:39:58.119 --> 00:39:59.719
I guess I was a little too focused.

00:40:02.589 --> 00:40:04.729
Here, eat this and wake up.

00:40:17.469 --> 00:40:19.439
Your turn. Here.

00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:21.339
Thanks.

00:40:24.209 --> 00:40:25.209
I'm a good sidekick, right?

00:40:25.949 --> 00:40:28.719
You're ridiculous sometimes. You know that?

00:40:31.749 --> 00:40:35.019
It seems she's headed to that hospital again.

00:40:36.219 --> 00:40:37.519
Then just head straight to the hospital.

00:40:37.859 --> 00:40:39.729
What if she turns off somewhere else?

00:40:39.789 --> 00:40:41.399
It's faster to get to the hospital from here anyway.

00:40:41.929 --> 00:40:44.569
Let's head toward the hospital, and if your mom turns off,

00:40:44.699 --> 00:40:45.969
we'll just follow her then.

00:40:46.729 --> 00:40:48.939
Wow, Park Yeong Ra. Your situational awareness is sharp.

00:40:49.739 --> 00:40:52.009
Your next webtoon should be a crime thriller.

00:40:53.909 --> 00:40:58.009
(Cheong Ah University Hospital)

00:41:05.289 --> 00:41:06.289
There's Mom's car.

00:41:12.459 --> 00:41:13.889
Looks like she came to the hospital after all.

00:41:15.059 --> 00:41:16.729
Do you want to go in and find her?

00:41:17.259 --> 00:41:19.269
But what if she sees us?

00:41:20.699 --> 00:41:22.399
I'm terrified she'll come out any second.

00:41:22.939 --> 00:41:24.969
I don't get it. You're so scared of Director Ko.

00:41:25.439 --> 00:41:26.439
Then why did you suggest we tail her?

00:41:28.509 --> 00:41:30.009
Why on earth did she come here?

00:41:30.079 --> 00:41:31.849
(Cheong Ah University Hospital)

00:41:33.249 --> 00:41:34.519
Seriously, should we just go in?

00:41:39.949 --> 00:41:41.519
The caregiver will be here after I leave.

00:41:43.919 --> 00:41:44.929
You're really something else, Mom.

00:41:46.929 --> 00:41:48.559
You always accomplish whatever you set your mind to.

00:41:51.369 --> 00:41:52.369
So you need to pull through, too.

00:41:53.729 --> 00:41:55.439
This is the second chance at life I'm giving you.

00:41:56.399 --> 00:41:57.639
Don't you forget it, and get well.

00:41:58.969 --> 00:42:00.269
That's your duty,

00:42:00.669 --> 00:42:02.309
and how you can show me your gratitude.

00:42:03.839 --> 00:42:05.279
Becoming the Chairman of Shoe Joy.

00:42:10.819 --> 00:42:12.219
- Hey. - Yes?

00:42:12.289 --> 00:42:13.719
Let's stake out the hospital starting tomorrow.

00:42:14.149 --> 00:42:16.989
A stakeout? Do you even know what a stakeout is?

00:42:17.289 --> 00:42:18.829
You were so scared just a minute ago.

00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:22.299
We won't use my car. We can just rent another one, right?

00:42:23.529 --> 00:42:25.229
You should really write a thriller for your next project.

00:42:25.669 --> 00:42:26.669
I'm serious.

00:42:27.099 --> 00:42:28.099
I'm renting one right now.

00:42:28.369 --> 00:42:31.869
No way. I told you. I have to take my grandpa to the airport tomorrow.

00:42:33.609 --> 00:42:34.609
Then the day after tomorrow.

00:42:35.679 --> 00:42:38.409
If you're serious enough about the stakeout to rent a car,

00:42:38.849 --> 00:42:40.979
tell me why. What's really on your mind?

00:42:43.549 --> 00:42:45.989
Jinhwa Group wants to organise an engagement ceremony.

00:42:46.719 --> 00:42:47.859
That's huge news, isn't it?

00:42:50.619 --> 00:42:51.659
I already told you.

00:42:52.489 --> 00:42:54.359
I just feel like it's something I need to know.

00:42:55.259 --> 00:42:57.359
Look, whatever the reason,

00:42:58.069 --> 00:43:00.229
this is where we'll find the answer.

00:43:00.299 --> 00:43:01.869
(Mom's car, Hospital)

00:43:04.299 --> 00:43:06.209
(Mom's car, Hospital)

00:43:09.339 --> 00:43:11.979
Ji Hyuk. You're home already? It's only 9pm.

00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:13.949
- Have you eaten dinner? - I already ate.

00:43:14.449 --> 00:43:16.649
You're not even going to say hello?

00:43:17.049 --> 00:43:18.049
Dad!

00:43:19.189 --> 00:43:20.249
Why are you making Mom work?

00:43:20.989 --> 00:43:21.989
What? What did you just say?

00:43:22.759 --> 00:43:26.729
Just because I'm not earning money and your mom makes my meals,

00:43:27.089 --> 00:43:28.399
are you trying to pick a fight with me?

00:43:28.859 --> 00:43:31.329
I offered to pay for our expenses, but you wouldn't let me.

00:43:31.729 --> 00:43:34.099
Was your plan to send Mom out to work for it instead?

00:43:34.839 --> 00:43:35.839
Ji Hyuk!

00:43:36.039 --> 00:43:40.469
Mom! I went to your store. I saw everything for myself.

00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:45.349
Wait, what is he talking about? A store?

00:43:45.849 --> 00:43:48.019
Have you been working somewhere?

00:43:49.449 --> 00:43:50.679
Tell me right now!

00:43:51.619 --> 00:43:53.519
Ji Hyuk, are you sure you're not mistaken?

00:43:54.559 --> 00:43:57.189
Wait, you didn't know either, Dad?

00:43:58.529 --> 00:44:00.759
- Kim Da Jeong! - Enough, both of you!

00:44:02.529 --> 00:44:04.259
Be quiet. Let me say something.

00:44:05.329 --> 00:44:08.699
So it's true? You've really been working?

00:44:09.299 --> 00:44:11.639
Yes. I was about to tell you.

00:44:12.969 --> 00:44:16.309
I just started at this new place. I worked at a restaurant before.

00:44:16.779 --> 00:44:17.779
I'm in a trial period,

00:44:17.779 --> 00:44:18.909
so I'm just working four hours a day.

00:44:19.479 --> 00:44:22.719
Wait, a restaurant?

00:44:23.279 --> 00:44:24.989
My hours will increase soon,

00:44:26.019 --> 00:44:27.089
so I was going to tell you then.

00:44:28.019 --> 00:44:30.989
Wait, you were working at a restaurant before this?

00:44:32.089 --> 00:44:33.959
What does it matter if it was a restaurant or a sales job?

00:44:34.159 --> 00:44:36.199
No, Mom. You have to quit right now.

00:44:37.029 --> 00:44:38.499
How much money do you need?

00:44:38.499 --> 00:44:40.369
- I'll cover it all. - Hey, you little punk!

00:44:40.429 --> 00:44:43.869
- Dad, stay out of it this time. - Ji Hyuk.

00:44:44.509 --> 00:44:45.769
I'm not taking your money.

00:44:46.339 --> 00:44:49.279
Mom, what are you talking about? Why won't you take my money?

00:44:49.439 --> 00:44:50.579
Because I'm going to keep working.

00:44:50.909 --> 00:44:51.909
Who says that's okay?

00:44:53.049 --> 00:44:55.679
Listen, even if you get a job, I'm going to keep working.

00:44:56.779 --> 00:44:57.779
Ji Hyuk,

00:44:58.119 --> 00:45:00.649
when you were going to get married, and when it all fell apart,

00:45:01.489 --> 00:45:04.419
it didn't just hurt your father. I was hurt too.

00:45:05.659 --> 00:45:09.959
You made it clear that you were ashamed of us as parents.

00:45:13.169 --> 00:45:16.099
Mom, that's not what I meant at all.

00:45:17.239 --> 00:45:18.569
I don't want to talk about that anymore.

00:45:19.669 --> 00:45:21.139
But even putting that aside,

00:45:21.639 --> 00:45:23.739
I don't want to be a burden on my kids.

00:45:24.379 --> 00:45:25.879
People live to be 100 these days.

00:45:27.249 --> 00:45:29.779
Ji Hyuk, your work with the business is amazing.

00:45:30.079 --> 00:45:31.849
I was so surprised and incredibly proud of you.

00:45:32.689 --> 00:45:35.359
But you got funding for that, right?

00:45:36.159 --> 00:45:37.819
Even with a successful business, you never know what can happen.

00:45:38.129 --> 00:45:40.259
But you have me, your father, your grandmother,

00:45:40.329 --> 00:45:42.759
and eventually your wife and kids all depending on you.

00:45:42.829 --> 00:45:43.829
What if your business goes under?

00:45:44.569 --> 00:45:45.569
What would you do then?

00:45:46.529 --> 00:45:50.099
And you're just like your father. You won't be able to abandon us,

00:45:50.169 --> 00:45:52.009
and you can't provide enough for your own kids.

00:45:52.469 --> 00:45:55.009
Then you'll end up resenting us. Who's to say that won't happen?

00:45:55.679 --> 00:45:56.679
Mom.

00:45:57.779 --> 00:46:01.219
So don't any of you dare tell me not to work!

00:46:01.719 --> 00:46:03.419
This is my life. I'll do what I want.

00:46:05.819 --> 00:46:10.119
Ji Wan, take the tray back. Su Bin, you clear up what's left.

00:46:10.959 --> 00:46:11.959
Okay.

00:46:12.359 --> 00:46:14.259
Ji Hyuk, you go wash up and rest upstairs.

00:46:15.029 --> 00:46:16.159
You've got a lot on your shoulders.

00:46:19.099 --> 00:46:20.099
Okay.

00:46:46.689 --> 00:46:50.159
How could you get a job without saying a word to me?

00:46:50.829 --> 00:46:52.269
Just drop it.

00:46:55.869 --> 00:46:56.869
Lee Sang Cheol.

00:46:57.939 --> 00:47:00.439
You weren't born just to provide for your wife.

00:47:01.169 --> 00:47:03.009
It's time to let go of that "sole provider" mindset.

00:47:06.779 --> 00:47:08.849
When my father was in the hospital for three months...

00:47:08.849 --> 00:47:10.479
after his first fishing boat accident,

00:47:11.219 --> 00:47:13.189
Ji Hyuk had just celebrated his first birthday.

00:47:14.249 --> 00:47:16.419
From then until he passed away three years ago,

00:47:16.489 --> 00:47:19.929
you and my mother were always taking turns caring for him.

00:47:20.029 --> 00:47:21.599
All while raising three kids.

00:47:22.029 --> 00:47:23.999
So how could I ever ask you to work on top of all that?

00:47:25.029 --> 00:47:26.469
Enough already.

00:47:27.569 --> 00:47:30.439
I told you. People live to be 100 these days.

00:47:31.809 --> 00:47:33.909
I'm going to stay at my dad's tonight.

00:47:34.879 --> 00:47:35.879
So I'll see you tomorrow.

00:47:45.719 --> 00:47:49.489
I wasn't born just to provide for my wife?

00:47:52.829 --> 00:47:55.199
I can't believe she'd say that for me.

00:48:07.469 --> 00:48:08.509
Another tough day, right?

00:48:11.239 --> 00:48:12.849
I don't know how to react to that.

00:48:15.119 --> 00:48:16.119
I'm sorry, Gang Oh.

00:48:16.979 --> 00:48:18.849
So, you're about to do something you'll regret.

00:48:19.149 --> 00:48:21.049
Gang Oh, go to your room. Now.

00:48:23.989 --> 00:48:24.989
Go on.

00:48:25.759 --> 00:48:27.489
You look like you've been wanting to say something.

00:48:37.469 --> 00:48:39.109
How long do you think it'll take for that blood tie...

00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:40.339
to matter more?

00:48:40.769 --> 00:48:43.079
Do you even know where Eun Oh and I stand right now?

00:48:44.809 --> 00:48:45.809
Mom.

00:48:46.879 --> 00:48:48.479
Let me just ask you one thing.

00:48:51.789 --> 00:48:54.119
If Gang Oh were the one who needed the liver transplant,

00:48:55.859 --> 00:48:56.919
what would you do?

00:48:58.189 --> 00:48:59.429
It's amazing how...

00:49:00.229 --> 00:49:02.899
they both know exactly where to stick the knife.

00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:10.539
Mom, if Gang Oh needed a liver transplant,

00:49:11.269 --> 00:49:12.269
you and I...

00:49:13.239 --> 00:49:15.539
We'd probably fight over who gets tested first.

00:49:17.239 --> 00:49:18.249
No, on second thought,

00:49:19.049 --> 00:49:22.619
we'd be running to the hospital hand in hand.

00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:24.349
That's enough.

00:49:25.819 --> 00:49:28.289
You don't have to say another word. I get it.

00:49:32.389 --> 00:49:34.689
I know you might not like her,

00:49:35.859 --> 00:49:37.429
but the one who needs the liver transplant...

00:49:39.029 --> 00:49:40.569
is my brother.

00:49:43.099 --> 00:49:45.239
The truth is, I don't even remember him.

00:49:46.739 --> 00:49:47.739
But...

00:49:49.279 --> 00:49:50.309
he's still my brother.

00:49:51.549 --> 00:49:52.549
My twin, at that.

00:49:55.649 --> 00:49:57.449
He'll die if I don't do it.

00:49:58.079 --> 00:49:59.519
If I just let him die...

00:50:01.819 --> 00:50:03.519
How could I live with myself?

00:50:06.589 --> 00:50:07.589
But, Eun Oh...

00:50:09.099 --> 00:50:10.099
What if...

00:50:11.059 --> 00:50:13.799
your birth mother only came looking for you for the liver transplant?

00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:17.339
No, that's not it at all.

00:50:17.899 --> 00:50:18.939
Just hear me out.

00:50:20.609 --> 00:50:22.309
The people at the orphanage were very clear.

00:50:22.879 --> 00:50:25.009
They said you were abandoned.

00:50:25.609 --> 00:50:26.849
With no name or anything.

00:50:27.209 --> 00:50:29.749
That's why we were able to do a full adoption.

00:50:32.389 --> 00:50:33.389
About that...

00:50:34.289 --> 00:50:35.659
She lost me,

00:50:36.219 --> 00:50:38.529
and someone else took me to the orphanage.

00:50:43.259 --> 00:50:45.329
All right. Fine.

00:50:47.599 --> 00:50:48.669
I won't try to stop you anymore.

00:50:49.769 --> 00:50:50.899
Do whatever you feel is right.

00:51:00.949 --> 00:51:01.949
Mom, thank you.

00:51:04.019 --> 00:51:05.219
And I'm sorry.

00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:08.559
I promise you...

00:51:09.359 --> 00:51:12.259
I'll make sure I stay healthy, just like I am now.

00:51:13.489 --> 00:51:14.489
Okay?

00:52:09.549 --> 00:52:10.549
My gosh.

00:52:11.449 --> 00:52:13.389
Dad, when was the last time we slept in the same room like this?

00:52:16.959 --> 00:52:19.459
Just the two of us?

00:52:20.859 --> 00:52:21.899
I don't think we ever have.

00:52:23.359 --> 00:52:24.359
I wish...

00:52:26.029 --> 00:52:27.599
we'd gone on a trip, just the two of us.

00:52:29.039 --> 00:52:31.399
What kind of daughter asks to go on a trip with her old dad?

00:52:36.379 --> 00:52:37.579
Dad, I'm so sorry.

00:52:38.449 --> 00:52:41.179
What for? Don't say you're sorry.

00:52:42.279 --> 00:52:43.979
If you're apologising,

00:52:46.349 --> 00:52:47.919
what about when you cared for your mom's dementia?

00:52:49.259 --> 00:52:50.389
I quit my job,

00:52:51.289 --> 00:52:53.829
and we relied on you kids for years.

00:52:54.489 --> 00:52:57.059
All we did was give you a little spending money.

00:52:57.899 --> 00:52:59.899
Besides, you're the one who sold your house to make ends meet.

00:53:02.239 --> 00:53:03.269
You know,

00:53:04.599 --> 00:53:08.709
in that movie, "Love Story," they said,

00:53:09.639 --> 00:53:11.109
"Love means..."

00:53:11.779 --> 00:53:14.449
"never having to say you're sorry."

00:53:16.419 --> 00:53:20.319
Dad, that line was for lovers.

00:53:20.649 --> 00:53:22.989
Still, you and I...

00:53:23.489 --> 00:53:25.229
We love each other too, don't we?

00:53:28.459 --> 00:53:29.659
Even without you saying a word,

00:53:30.859 --> 00:53:32.029
I know exactly how you feel.

00:53:36.199 --> 00:53:37.199
Dad.

00:53:39.709 --> 00:53:41.139
Was I a good daughter?

00:53:41.879 --> 00:53:43.139
What kind of question is that?

00:53:46.509 --> 00:53:47.509
Just having you...

00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:51.849
as my daughter...

00:53:54.989 --> 00:53:57.219
has been the greatest joy.

00:54:01.359 --> 00:54:02.359
Me too.

00:54:04.329 --> 00:54:05.899
Having you as my dad...

00:54:07.299 --> 00:54:08.369
I was always so happy.

00:54:10.639 --> 00:54:11.639
Oh, sweetie.

00:54:13.139 --> 00:54:14.569
Lying here with you,

00:54:15.439 --> 00:54:16.809
it feels like we're on vacation.

00:54:41.129 --> 00:54:43.439
All right, everyone, get in. We should leave with time to spare.

00:54:43.569 --> 00:54:44.669
All right.

00:54:51.609 --> 00:54:52.609
Here.

00:54:52.879 --> 00:54:56.449
I packed you some hard-boiled eggs and rice balls.

00:54:57.249 --> 00:54:59.849
- These are for your airport trip. - Oh, you shouldn't have.

00:55:02.759 --> 00:55:03.759
Ok Rye,

00:55:04.159 --> 00:55:08.259
thank you for being a good friend to me.

00:55:10.099 --> 00:55:12.829
From now on, don't just live on the sidelines.

00:55:13.329 --> 00:55:16.799
Be the star of your own show, right in the spotlight.

00:55:17.299 --> 00:55:18.299
Okay.

00:55:18.939 --> 00:55:19.939
I plan on it.

00:55:21.539 --> 00:55:24.179
Okay, you two, no more goodbyes. Hurry and get in.

00:55:24.239 --> 00:55:26.449
Never you mind. This is just between us.

00:55:27.679 --> 00:55:28.679
All right, then.

00:55:33.689 --> 00:55:34.689
I'm off.

00:55:36.959 --> 00:55:38.629
We'll be going now, Mother.

00:55:39.159 --> 00:55:40.159
Okay.

00:55:40.929 --> 00:55:43.129
- Drive safe. - I will.

00:55:45.869 --> 00:55:48.399
Have a safe trip, Jang Su.

00:56:13.529 --> 00:56:14.529
Did you sleep well?

00:56:18.459 --> 00:56:20.399
I did. And you?

00:56:21.329 --> 00:56:23.199
You really admire her, don't you?

00:56:27.739 --> 00:56:29.109
I've told you before.

00:56:29.709 --> 00:56:31.879
When we met a few times because of work,

00:56:32.079 --> 00:56:35.049
I thought, "Wow, I really want to be like her."

00:56:35.819 --> 00:56:39.889
- That's how amazing she was. - Right, I remember you saying that.

00:56:42.959 --> 00:56:44.619
Looking back on it now,

00:56:44.889 --> 00:56:46.829
I wonder if that's why I felt such a strong connection.

00:56:48.089 --> 00:56:50.699
She was always good at picking up on how I was feeling.

00:56:51.529 --> 00:56:53.329
Especially when I was struggling with Gang Oh.

00:56:53.799 --> 00:56:54.799
Here.

00:56:57.369 --> 00:56:58.369
It's a calming candy.

00:56:59.669 --> 00:57:01.069
Calming candy?

00:57:01.909 --> 00:57:04.639
Not really. It's just a name I made up.

00:57:05.609 --> 00:57:08.049
I eat one when I'm feeling sad or down...

00:57:08.049 --> 00:57:09.879
because of old memories that resurface.

00:57:10.649 --> 00:57:11.949
It actually cheers me up.

00:57:16.159 --> 00:57:17.459
When I'm with her,

00:57:18.119 --> 00:57:21.029
you have no idea how naturally she lifts my spirits.

00:57:21.429 --> 00:57:23.759
Hearing you talk about it is really moving.

00:57:24.229 --> 00:57:26.599
To think the woman you admired is your birth mother.

00:57:28.469 --> 00:57:32.069
But then, when I hear what Ji Hyuk says,

00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:33.869
it all just sounds so dramatic.

00:57:34.969 --> 00:57:37.239
I'm just so confused. I don't know what to believe.

00:57:40.949 --> 00:57:44.119
Apparently, her family struggled when she was young.

00:57:44.719 --> 00:57:48.119
But look at her now, funding students and artists.

00:57:48.919 --> 00:57:50.159
To me, that's just...

00:57:51.419 --> 00:57:55.659
When you've struggled yourself, you can't help but see it in others.

00:57:55.959 --> 00:57:58.059
You've even set your mother up so she's taken care of.

00:57:58.699 --> 00:58:01.429
And quitting a great company like Doogle...

00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:03.669
That's not something just anyone can do.

00:58:08.569 --> 00:58:09.579
Su Jeong.

00:58:09.939 --> 00:58:13.049
- We have a location to upload. - Oh, really?

00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:14.309
Okay.

00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:16.219
Let's talk later.

00:58:18.919 --> 00:58:21.019
You've even set your mother up so she's taken care of.

00:58:21.689 --> 00:58:24.359
And quitting a great company like Doogle...

00:58:24.819 --> 00:58:26.659
That's not something just anyone can do.

00:58:29.499 --> 00:58:31.999
I don't recall ever telling her...

00:58:32.229 --> 00:58:35.229
about helping my mom financially or quitting my old job.

00:58:39.339 --> 00:58:40.909
There are some red flags.

00:58:41.269 --> 00:58:42.639
You got the commission in the spring.

00:58:43.579 --> 00:58:45.849
And she's been getting close to you all this time.

00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:48.209
The people at the orphanage were very clear.

00:58:48.609 --> 00:58:50.879
They said you were abandoned.

00:58:51.179 --> 00:58:52.719
With no name or anything.

00:58:52.989 --> 00:58:55.519
That's why we were able to do a full adoption.

00:59:02.899 --> 00:59:03.959
What about before the leak?

00:59:04.629 --> 00:59:05.899
You got the commission in the spring.

00:59:06.569 --> 00:59:08.599
It's been months, and construction hasn't even started yet.

00:59:10.439 --> 00:59:12.739
It doesn't look like they did any exterior work.

00:59:14.109 --> 00:59:15.679
Maybe they just waterproofed the roof?

00:59:16.139 --> 00:59:19.149
But just waterproofing the roof only takes a few days.

00:59:25.419 --> 00:59:26.519
Why won't this go in?

00:59:33.559 --> 00:59:34.589
Can I help you?

00:59:36.659 --> 00:59:39.799
I'm the designer for the interior renovation here.

00:59:40.229 --> 00:59:41.599
Is the waterproofing done?

00:59:42.099 --> 00:59:44.869
If anyone comes by asking about the leak repairs,

00:59:44.969 --> 00:59:48.209
tell them it's been delayed because it keeps getting rained out.

00:59:49.739 --> 00:59:51.079
Not yet.

00:59:51.339 --> 00:59:54.379
It rains every time we schedule it.

00:59:54.849 --> 00:59:56.849
We've had so much rain this year.

00:59:59.149 --> 01:00:00.819
Right. This year's been a rainy one.

01:00:03.119 --> 01:00:04.519
At this rate, we'll be into next year.

01:00:10.499 --> 01:00:11.759
Before I forget,

01:00:13.999 --> 01:00:15.939
here's the key to the shop.

01:00:23.379 --> 01:00:26.549
But I've used this key to get in so many times.

01:00:28.409 --> 01:00:29.879
Did they just change the lock?

01:00:45.429 --> 01:00:47.399
The leak repairs are one thing,

01:00:48.869 --> 01:00:50.499
but why change the lock?

01:00:55.709 --> 01:00:58.809
What do you mean? The lease was just signed last week.

01:01:00.709 --> 01:01:01.709
No.

01:01:02.419 --> 01:01:04.019
We signed the lease in the spring.

01:01:04.749 --> 01:01:05.889
In the spring.

01:01:06.189 --> 01:01:08.549
That was a short-term lease for six months.

01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:11.959
A short-term lease for six months?

01:01:12.059 --> 01:01:15.089
That lease ended last month. Last week, someone else...

01:01:15.159 --> 01:01:16.599
signed a new two-year lease.

01:01:26.639 --> 01:01:30.179
In the spring. That was a short-term lease for six months.

01:01:30.709 --> 01:01:35.179
The landlord had the leak inspected, and it needs major repairs.

01:01:35.549 --> 01:01:38.679
So our schedule might get pushed back.

01:01:39.949 --> 01:01:41.589
So you happen to meet a client.

01:01:42.559 --> 01:01:43.689
And it turns out she's your birth mother.

01:01:44.959 --> 01:01:46.029
And on top of that,

01:01:46.659 --> 01:01:47.959
she asks you for a liver transplant.

01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:49.959
It's all a little too...

01:01:50.899 --> 01:01:51.929
perfect, don't you think?

01:01:59.539 --> 01:02:02.609
Diabetes. It's hypoglycaemic shock. Please help me.

01:02:02.909 --> 01:02:06.509
I was curious about this designer. It was you.

01:02:06.649 --> 01:02:08.449
How about 30,000 dollars as a fee?

01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:17.419
I'm giving you courage.

01:02:17.989 --> 01:02:20.659
I thought I was done with leaks in my life.

01:02:21.429 --> 01:02:23.959
I don't even know what cold ground that poor child is lying in.

01:02:25.259 --> 01:02:26.729
What if they didn't abandon you,

01:02:27.329 --> 01:02:29.099
but lost you instead?

01:02:30.639 --> 01:02:32.069
Do you consent to the sample collection?

01:02:33.539 --> 01:02:35.839
- Yes. - Open wide.

01:02:49.959 --> 01:02:52.259
In life, things don't just fall into place so perfectly like this.

01:02:53.459 --> 01:02:55.529
You got tested to see if you match for a liver transplant, right?

01:02:55.899 --> 01:02:58.029
Maybe she found you just because she needed your liver.

01:03:11.609 --> 01:03:13.149
So that's what this was all about?

01:03:49.149 --> 01:03:52.149
(Our Golden Days)

01:03:52.419 --> 01:03:54.949
How can I eat when I'm not even earning my keep?

01:03:55.319 --> 01:03:57.989
I'd like to share what we three siblings decided.

01:03:58.219 --> 01:04:01.129
Dad, I don't want to get engaged. I can't even kiss him.

01:04:01.289 --> 01:04:02.759
Were you that greedy for Jinhwa Group?

01:04:02.829 --> 01:04:05.459
You little brat. Who are you to talk to your dad like that?

01:04:05.529 --> 01:04:07.099
What was that stunt all about?

01:04:07.429 --> 01:04:11.769
- No way. With Seong Jae? For real? - What have I done?

01:04:12.239 --> 01:04:13.709
Why was I the only one she abandoned?

01:04:13.909 --> 01:04:17.379
What if your birth mother isn't who you think she is?

01:04:17.539 --> 01:04:18.839
