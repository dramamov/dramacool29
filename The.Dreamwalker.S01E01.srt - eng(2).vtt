00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.240
Hurry up, hurry up.

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:54.919
Take a look at this female corpse.

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:56.080
Can it be turned into a Yin Corpse?

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:07.599
This female corpse—

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:10.319
She was born in a Yin year, month, day, and hour.

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:11.519
She is a person of pure Yin.

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:13.319
Then—

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:14.720
This time, you need to pay me more.

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:19.680
Wait a moment.

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:22.559
Why does her Yin meridian seem off?

00:01:22.839 --> 00:01:24.199
What’s wrong with it?

00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:25.440
With you, Immortal Lady, here,

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:27.199
are you still worried she won’t revive?

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.680
There’s something behind you.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.119
Immortal Lady!

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:16.639
Immortal Lady, please spare me!

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.880
He Fuyi!

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.520
Wake up, wake up!

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.119
Where am I?

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:50.399
You’re finally awake.

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.639
You fainted on the street again last night.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.399
Those people just picked you up.

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:55.479
They brought you here.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.639
They said they’d use you to make a corpse.

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:59.800
You just watched me fall into danger?

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.279
If not for that nail just now,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.240
I wouldn’t be able to leave the lamp.

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.039
You haven’t refilled the lamp oil in ages.

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:12.119
You ended up in kidnappers’ hands.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.520
Aqi.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.080
I remember before I fainted,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.279
the Seven Stars Lamp caught a new dream.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.600
We need to enter the dream quickly.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.720
Help the dead resolve their obsession.

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:22.039
Gather new spirit aura.

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:23.039
Refill the lamp oil.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.240
Otherwise—

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.479
we’ll both be doomed.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.600
Seven Stars guides the lingering dream.

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:35.520
Lonely soul crosses the Yellow Springs.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.639
Enter the dream.

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:50.199
Sir—

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.080
She won’t eat her last meal.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.000
She may not rest in peace after death.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.720
Liu Chunru.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.520
Why won’t you eat?

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:00.639
If you have any last words,

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:01.639
speak them quickly.

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:03.960
I will fulfill your wishes.

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:06.600
After I die,

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:08.679
I want you to

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:10.479
bury me whole and intact.

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:12.479
This rebel—

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.000
is obsessed with a whole burial before death.

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:16.559
If you refuse,

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.559
I won’t eat this last meal.

00:04:24.359 --> 00:04:25.519
How about this—

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:26.440
Liu Chunru,

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.799
if all your blood after death

00:04:27.799 --> 00:04:29.880
can stain this white silk,

00:04:30.119 --> 00:04:31.040
I

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.519
will make a red robe from it.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.760
Then I’ll have you

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.839
buried whole.

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:36.040
How about that?

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:38.040
Swearing to the dead

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.079
must be kept.

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:41.839
If you break your promise,

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.559
I won’t let you go after death.

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:48.040
I agree.

00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:06.679
Carry out the execution.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.720
Guards!

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.200
Hang this rebel’s head

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:24.480
on the city gate for all to see.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.279
The body—

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:26.480
throw it in the mass grave.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.279
Sir—

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.519
The white silk is stained red.

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:34.480
You fulfilled Liu Chunru’s last wish.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.760
If you break your promise,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.720
I’m afraid—

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.480
Th-this—

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.760
It’s another nightmare.

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:48.000
The person in the dream is Liu Chunru.

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:51.079
She wants to be buried whole in the dream.

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:52.880
So her obsession

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:54.839
is just to recover her body?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.320
We need to hurry to town.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.959
Steal Liu Chunru’s body.

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:02.559
I have a good idea.

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:16.119
Do you think these rebels are worth it?

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.480
She’s just a woman.

00:06:17.799 --> 00:06:19.760
She didn’t even blink at her beheading.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.359
I actually admire her.

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:23.519
Keep your voice down.

00:06:23.799 --> 00:06:24.679
Do you want to die?

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.839
Why not do something else?

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:28.359
Why rebel?

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.239
Foolish child.

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:16.799
Liu Chunru—

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.799
Every wrong has its culprit.

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:20.880
Don’t come after me.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.200
I’m just a humble coroner.

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:38.119
Your humble servant greets you, Prince.

00:07:38.119 --> 00:07:39.640
I didn’t know the Prince would visit.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.760
Forgive me for not welcoming you sooner.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.200
Enough chatter.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.839
Liu Chunru’s body is missing.

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:45.880
How could you be so careless?

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.799
The body is missing?

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:47.839
How is that possible?

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:49.440
You oversaw the execution today.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.880
We saw Liu Chunru’s body

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.880
displayed after beheading.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.640
Now—

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.959
her head is at the east city gate.

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:55.440
Her body is at the west charity graveyard.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.640
Everything was done by imperial rules.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.880
How could she be missing?

00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.640
Enough nonsense.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.440
Where’s your county magistrate?

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.320
Can he still sleep?

00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:02.239
Please calm your anger, Prince.

00:08:02.559 --> 00:08:03.079
I—

00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:04.239
will fetch the magistrate right away.

00:08:22.359 --> 00:08:23.079
What happened?

00:08:23.079 --> 00:08:24.000
Did you kill him?

00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:25.399
No, it wasn’t me!

00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:28.760
It was a female ghost! A female ghost!

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.200
It was Liu Chunru!

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:31.880
Liu Chunru has returned for revenge!

00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:38.559
Who is it?

00:08:43.239 --> 00:08:44.640
Who is it, really?

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.479
Who?

00:08:53.479 --> 00:08:54.159
Go and check.

00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:55.520
Who is it, really?

00:08:55.719 --> 00:08:56.520
Master—

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.719
I’m scared.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.919
Go open the door.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.640
Master—

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.880
There’s no one outside.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.719
Ruizhi—

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.039
Ruizhi—

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.400
If you don’t believe me,

00:09:49.159 --> 00:09:50.960
come and see for yourself.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.119
She came back for her head.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.119
If she can’t find her head,

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.840
she’ll come back again.

00:10:12.039 --> 00:10:13.400
She will come back again.

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:20.200
She’s not dead.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.000
She just fainted.

00:10:21.239 --> 00:10:22.280
Why are you still standing there?

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.239
Call the doctor.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.599
The one inside—

00:10:54.919 --> 00:10:55.599
Who is she?

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.599
She’s a concubine of our household.

00:10:59.599 --> 00:11:01.320
She’s a student at Jingyang Girls’ School.

00:11:01.479 --> 00:11:02.159
A student?

00:11:02.159 --> 00:11:03.039
No, no.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.280
Prince, please judge fairly.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.520
Our concubine—

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.200
She was only working at the school.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.640
Just doing cleaning chores.

00:11:08.799 --> 00:11:10.520
She’s never been involved in anything rebellious—

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.799
Or any corrupt ideas.

00:11:11.919 --> 00:11:12.880
Keep a close watch on her.

00:11:13.479 --> 00:11:13.880
Let’s go.

00:11:14.239 --> 00:11:16.000
Isn’t she trying to get that head back?

00:11:16.159 --> 00:11:17.280
Let’s go guard it.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.039
Her head that’s on display.

00:11:24.239 --> 00:11:25.039
Sir, please judge fairly.

00:11:26.239 --> 00:11:26.880
I—

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.359
Wouldn’t dare hide anything.

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:29.760
Every word is true.

00:11:29.919 --> 00:11:31.159
There really was a haunting.

00:11:31.599 --> 00:11:32.960
Liu Chunru’s corpse—

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.479
It really got up and walked.

00:11:35.479 --> 00:11:36.119
Nonsense.

00:11:36.599 --> 00:11:37.840
If not that—

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.760
Then you failed to guard it.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.039
And let the criminal’s body be taken.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.080
Stop stalling. Tell the truth now.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.840
While I’m still in a good mood.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.400
I might spare you.

00:11:48.239 --> 00:11:49.599
Sir, please judge fairly.

00:11:49.719 --> 00:11:50.880
The mortuary’s rule is—

00:11:51.359 --> 00:11:53.479
Both doors are locked at the hour of the pig.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.559
When I woke up just now,

00:11:56.039 --> 00:11:58.479
The red lock on the main door was intact.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.440
But the black lock on the inner door—

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.520
Was open.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.359
Liu Chunru’s corpse—

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.000
Was gone too.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.599
Isn’t that her turning into a corpse fiend?

00:12:07.599 --> 00:12:08.880
She left on her own.

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:15.080
Take him away.

00:12:15.679 --> 00:12:16.239
Th-this—

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.559
Sir! Sir!

00:12:18.159 --> 00:12:18.799
Sir!

00:12:18.799 --> 00:12:19.280
Go.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:19.960
It wasn’t me!

00:12:20.599 --> 00:12:22.280
Who would dare—

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.960
Go to such lengths to bury a traitor?

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.119
They must have a death wish.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.239
Prince.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.239
Stop!

00:12:51.359 --> 00:12:52.200
Whose girl is this?

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.080
Why is she so fierce?

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.960
She’s clearly not a normal girl.

00:12:58.159 --> 00:12:59.520
A demon—demon child!

00:13:00.039 --> 00:13:01.000
Protect!

00:13:12.239 --> 00:13:13.359
I’ll trade something with you.
