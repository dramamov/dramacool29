you resigned and returned home.

I simply couldn't keep you.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.490

Back then, the court reeked of corruption.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.890
I refused to join in the filth.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.010
Now,

the world is slowly growing cleaner.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.530
So I'm willing to come out of retirement.

Master Li,

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.010
may I ask whether there is any problem

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.010
with Mr. Song Lanxi's identity?

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:28.490
Lanxi,

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:30.820
I've told you long ago:

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.420
no matter when,

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.580
you must stand tall.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.300
It's nothing more than some schemer failing to have you killed

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.650
and now trying to sling mud instead.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:43.580
As your teacher,

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:44.980
I'll stand up for you!

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.460
Since that's the case,

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.890
I ask all of you

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:03.890
to wait for the results of the palace exam.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.420
Not even a word of praise for me.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:18.130
Using me and then kicking me away,

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:19.490
how heartless of you!

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:26.770
Grand Tutor Ling.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.620
[Taiji Hall]

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.610
You've schemed for years,

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.700
and now your career is about to collapse.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.300
You must have lost your mind

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.700
after the loss of your beloved daughter.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.420
Why are you talking such nonsense?

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.370
Don't provoke me like this.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.650
This whole situation now

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.820
is all thanks to your fine disciple.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.850
You're not much better off than I am.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:11.740
[Writing]

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.220
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.650
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:32.180
You turned things around in the palace exam.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.460
You specially summoned me here

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.130
just to offer congratulations?

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.220
Yesterday, Imperial Physician Li sent someone over

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.650
and had the Frost Reed delivered.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:45.100
So he has really found it?

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.530
With this key herb that can dispel all poisons,

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.130
your cold sickness

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:50.530
may finally be cured.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:53.730
That's wonderful.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:56.890
I've specially prepared a banquet

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.130
to celebrate for Your Majesty.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.220
Thanks for your kindness,

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.460
but I still have matters to attend to.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:02.650
I'll take my leave.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.220
Your Majesty just can't wait

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.460
to share this good news

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.820
with the Empress, is that it?

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.980
That is between the Empress and me.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:16.820
Mind your words.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.530
In that case,

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.460
I wish Your Majesty

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:38.820
long life and endless blessings.

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:40.730
May you find joy,

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.060
find the one you love,

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:44.980
and never be lost in doubt again.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:50.300
Madam,

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.060
don't let stray desires take root.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:54.700
All of you, leave.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.100
Yes, Madam.

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:15.380
- Your Highness! - Your Highness!

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:18.460
- Your Highness! - Your Highness!

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.090
Your Highness!

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.660
I want to go out.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:26.380
If you won't let me out, fine.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.940
How about this?

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.660
Pick one of you to stand right here

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.810
so I can "light a lantern" on him.

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:34.730
Please spare us!

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.010
What is the Princess up to now?

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:38.730
Commander Li,

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.220
you'll see once you're there.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.700
Actually, we don't even need fire.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.900
One of these days I'll sprinkle some powder on you,

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.730
and it'll burst into flame at night all on its own.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:53.730
It'll be so much fun!

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.700
Spare us, Your Highness!

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:01.940
Your Highness.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.940
Please stop causing trouble.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.490
What?

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:08.330
Want to punish me by putting out the lights again?

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.220
I'm telling you, my brother is back.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:11.980
I'm not scared anymore!

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:12.810
Forgive me.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:17.460
- Your Highness! - Your Highness!

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:18.570
You mustn't do that!

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.570
If my powder hadn't been destroyed,

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:23.940
you'd already be dead!

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:26.490
I have so many kinds of poison.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:27.570
Deadly with just a touch!

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:43.420
Your Highness,

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.140
what are you trying to do?

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:52.490
Whatever you want me to do,

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.330
I'll do it.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.140
Say it...

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.050
what do you want me to do?

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.530
I would like Your Highness

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.730
to spare my men

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.180
and go back to your chambers to rest.

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:13.700
Fine.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:21.250
How long do I have to rest?

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:24.050
How about

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:25.810
you rest until tomorrow?

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:28.330
All right.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:39.730
I'll go rest now.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.050
See you tomorrow.

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:48.570
Finding you

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.290
makes me really happy.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.420
Sir.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.620
- Are you okay? - Are you alright?

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:14.810
What are you looking at?

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:18.810
Do I look that bad?

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:23.810
Am I poisoned or something?

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.860
Your Majesty,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.940
this is the pear blossom honey Grand Tutor Ling brought today.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.460
I added four spoonfuls, just as he ordered.

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:40.180
It really does smell sweet.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.050
Whenever Father went away,

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:47.010
he would always bring me a gift,

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.900
like milk dates,

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:49.980
candied fruit,

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.050
mooncakes,

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.570
and this pear blossom honey.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.420
He really dotes on Your Majesty.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:20.810
His Majesty arrives!

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:30.810
It's so late.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.570
What brings you here?

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.380
I've had two pieces of good news today,

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.010
so I wanted to come see my empress.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:39.810
What good news?

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.250
There's hope for my cold sickness.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.770
I no longer have to fear

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.860
that one day, I'll suddenly leave you behind.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.570
What's wrong?

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:30.940
I'm not sure.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.290
I just have a bit of a headache.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.490
Here.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.490
You're burning up.

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:57.730
I'll call the imperial physician to take a look.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.860
I'm fine.

should I trust you one more time?

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.010
Your Majesty!

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:13.570
Someone, come quickly!

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.660
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.530
She has always been in good health.

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:31.250
How could she suddenly pass out?

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.460
Your Majesty,

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:34.940
Her Majesty

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.250
has been poisoned.

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:38.620
Poisoned?

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.660
How could the Empress be poisoned?

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:42.530
What kind of poison is it?

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.140
A vicious, rare toxin.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.660
It's already entered Her Majesty's bloodstream.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.660
Her temperature keeps dropping.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.730
This poison

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.620
seems to be suppressing her heartbeat.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.900
If this goes on,

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:54.290
Her Majesty will lose all body heat.

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:55.530
I'm afraid

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.860
in a few hours,

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:58.620
there will be no saving her.

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:03.730
How could she be poisoned

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:05.940
here in the inner palace?

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:08.010
She was perfectly fine just yesterday.

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:09.810
Speak!

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:12.090
Your Majesty,

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.490
aside from this toxin,

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:15.290
Her Majesty also seems to have taken

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:17.180
Lovesickness Powder.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.050
Lovesickness Powder?

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:20.940
How do we cure it?

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:25.420
I think I've seen it before at Princess Ying's place.

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:49.620
Don't be afraid.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.380
He said

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.660
I shouldn't make things hard for you,

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.860
so I won't.

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:00.380
I'll wait for him to come.

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:05.250
I knew it.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:06.620
You were bound to come!

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.050
I warned you.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.140
You can hate me, even kill me,

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:14.860
but you may not touch my empress.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.530
Give me the antidote.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.530
What antidote?

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.570
I'll say it one more time.

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.380
Give me the antidote!

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:31.050
Your Highness.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.290
I've waited for you all day.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.250
Hurry up and tell your master

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:36.900
that I didn't poison the Empress.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:40.900
Xiao Ying,

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.530
I'm not joking with you.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.770
Ying says she didn't.

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:48.140
Your Majesty,

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:49.980
what's going on?

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.700
You're not asking what really happened.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:53.810
You're just lashing out.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.810
Cangcang's poisoned.

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.330
The imperial physician says he's only seen it in the cold palace.

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:00.420
If Ying really used it,

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:02.010
would she deny it?

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.730
Every day she shouts about killing you.

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:08.090
Has she ever done something and not owned up to it?

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.770
There may be someone trying to frame her.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:17.810
Your Highness,

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.530
the Empress's poison

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:21.420
really wasn't your doing?

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:22.860
You came by yesterday.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.250
You told me to go rest, so I did.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:27.250
I only just came here to wait for you.

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:28.530
How would I poison anyone?

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:30.940
Is that so?

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.380
Since noon yesterday,

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:35.770
Princess Ying hasn't taken a step out of the cold palace.

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:37.770
I stake my life on it.

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:40.980
After the Empress was poisoned,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:41.860
her whole body turned cold

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.250
and the veins in her face went blue and purple.

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:46.140
What kind of poison is this?

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:47.460
Is there an antidote?

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.660
It sounds like...

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:54.010
Frostflower.

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:57.460
But I don't have an antidote.

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:00.050
I only brew poisons to kill you.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.420
Why would I bother making antidotes?

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:05.250
Can you make one or not?

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.940
I already said there is no antidote.

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.180
Her temples have gone purple,

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.940
which means she'll be dead in a few hours.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:15.330
Even if someone can make an antidote,

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:16.530
she won't live to see it.

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:22.090
Li Hongqing.

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.770
Here.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.730
Go to Nanrong Palace at once.

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:25.380
Understood.

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:31.090
Your Majesty.

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:33.050
As for this matter,

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.810
you haven't told Preceptor Du, have you?

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.250
No.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.140
Your Majesty...

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:42.570
Let go.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.530
Imperial Physician Li has searched for ten years for it.

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:47.090
It's your lifesaving medicine.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.050
Ten years, that's all.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.770
I managed to wait before.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.530
I can keep waiting now.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.660
Your Majesty...

00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:58.660
Go back.

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:00.290
You should know

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:01.900
that once I've made a decision,

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.900
no one can change it.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:07.490
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:16.380
Your Majesty.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.250
Xiaoshan,

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:19.980
grind this into powder,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.010
mix it with water and bring it in.

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:22.810
I will use it to cleanse the poison from the Empress.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.050
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:25.090
I'll go at once.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:44.250
Commander Li took away the Frost Reed.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.700
Is it because Imperial Physician Li is back?

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.180
Seems not.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:49.570
Commander Li said

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:50.490
if you return,

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:52.900
you'd better go straight to Linghe Hall.

If you have something to say,

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:05.250

There's no need for this.

I'm not dead yet.

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:39.770
You can't afford to wait another ten years

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.220
for the Frost Reed.

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.620
There may still be hope.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.050
From now on,

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.940
I will do exactly as you say.

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.530
I'll take the medicine and the needles

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:51.810
without so much as a frown.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.810
Who did this?

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:57.980
I'll investigate at once.

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:00.700
No need.

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:03.860
At first, I thought it was Xiao Ying.

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:06.180
But when I returned to Linghe Hall

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:08.050
and checked everything carefully,

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:09.570
I understood.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:16.780
This

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.690
is the pear blossom honey Cangcang has loved since childhood.

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:21.490
Yesterday,

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:23.570
Grand Tutor Ling sent it over.

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:26.210
And the poison

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:27.740
was hidden right inside it.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.090
The imperial physician also said

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:33.210
that in what Cangcang was given,

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:34.860
there was not only a fatal toxin

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:37.130
but also Lovesickness Powder.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.820
We found an important lead:

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:03.610
the cure for His Majesty's cold sickness,

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:04.380
the rare Frost Reed,

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:05.690
has finally been found.

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:10.470
If we lay the Lovesickness Powder and the poison

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.210
only on the very top layer of honey,

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.460
can you guarantee the honey beneath is clean?

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.780
I can, my lord.

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.650
I once trained under the Tang Clan.

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:22.740
I would never leave any trace behind.

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.820
You may rest assured.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.380
This poison

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.530
was stolen from Princess Ying

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:30.420
by an undercover agent in the palace, wasn't it?

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:31.260
Yes.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:32.900
I heard

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.860
His Majesty has already visited the cold palace

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.170
and seems to have cleared Princess Ying.

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:38.900
It doesn't matter.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.610
With no solid proof,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.050
even if His Majesty suspects something,

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:43.860
this case

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:46.300
can only be left hanging.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:50.940
Speak.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:54.530
My lord,

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:56.380
this Frostflower poison

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.490
is incredibly vicious.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.610
If used carelessly, it could take a life.

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:02.820
Are you truly not worried about Young Lady?

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.820
If you had a daughter

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:16.170
who grew up fair and clever,

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:17.820
treasured like a pearl in your palm,

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.860
could you not worry,

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:25.340
not feel pain?

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.010
I've long since prepared the antidote.

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:33.340
In the last round,

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:35.650
I lost.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.850
So I decided

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.490
to place one more bet.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.340
I bet that someone else's feelings for Cangcang

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:47.820
run deeper

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:50.010
than mine.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.210
He's gambling.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.050
Word about the Frost Reed

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:55.420
must have leaked out.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.260
He's betting

00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:00.050
that I won't just stand by and watch Cangcang die,

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:02.570
that I'll definitely use the Frost Reed

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.090
to save her life.

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.980
And once I do,

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:08.050
I won't live much longer.

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:10.340
He can pin it all on Xiao Ying,

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.210
and even stir up strife between me and the Empress Dowager.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:14.860
And after that,

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:17.740
if the Empress conceives my heir,

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:19.210
this round

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:21.420
really will be three birds with one stone.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.690
As for this,

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:26.820
you already knew it

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:29.260
before treating the Empress?

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.050
This matter

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.690
cannot simply be let go!

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.530
Are you really going to wait

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:48.570
and let Ling Xuefeng become regent again one day?

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.940
You must not soften again.

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:07.690
If the Empress bears an heir,

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.820
Ling Xuefeng will surely rebel.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:12.010
As Grand Tutor Ling is now,

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.340
he's resorting to desperate measures.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.980
[Linghe Hall]

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.010
You must not soften again.

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.260
If the Empress bears an heir,

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:03.300
Ling Xuefeng will surely rebel.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.340
You're awake.

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.420
What happened to me?

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.340
You were poisoned.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.260
Poisoned?

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:37.690
Who did it?

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.260
The Empress Dowager?

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:46.570
It doesn't matter anymore.

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:48.570
What matters is,

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.690
the poison has been cleared.

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:55.650
People in this inner palace

00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:59.530

What's wrong?

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:14.650
You look so grim.

What kind of medicine is this?

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:48.780
Is it bitter?

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.260
