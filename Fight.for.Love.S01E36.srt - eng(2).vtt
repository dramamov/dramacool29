(Arsenal Bureau)

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.870
General Song, why did you stop?

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.430
I believed His Majesty ordered you

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.200
to escort me all the way

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.640
to the Arsenal Bureau's secret room.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.430
His Majesty ordered

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.480
you should be confined here.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.120
So, from this day on,

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.990
I will take charge

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.440
of patrolling and defending

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.760
the Arsenal Bureau.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.440
So Your Lordship,

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.600
please give me the Fish-shaped Tally.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.480
What if I tell you

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.830
I'm not carrying it with me?

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.360
Your Lordship,

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.270
are you defying the Emperor's order?

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.580
I know you are

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.260
far more powerful,

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.820
but I've never witnessed it myself.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.460
If you continue to disobey the order,

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.580
I will have no choice but to use force.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.940
Your Lordship,

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.340
you do have a high opinion of yourself.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.140
You wouldn't join me

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.340
for some tea

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.660
unless I came to invite you.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.980
Oh, General Song.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.340
You're in high spirits.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.300
You came to my bureau

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.140
looking for a fight.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.500
That's good.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.140
I love anything exciting.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.740
How about this?

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.940
Let me join you.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.420
General Song,

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.860
it seems you have

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.300
a taste for fighting.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.660
Why are your weapons

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.140
pointed at one of our own?

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.180
You are new here

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.620
and don't know the rules.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.620
In this bureau,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.900
no weapons are to be drawn

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.380
without my order.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.700
At the order of His Majesty,

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.180
I request Wei Yun to give me
the Fish-shaped Tally.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.140
Commander Lu, if you

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.380
interfere with my mission,

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.260
you will be considered an accomplice.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.300
Take it.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.940
Since you want it,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.180
you take it.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.900
But it's not His Majesty's decree

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.020
that can trap me in this place.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.500
Let alone you.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.460
Alright.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.540
General Song,

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.940
we're on the same team.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:17.780
Look. Young Marquis Wei

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:18.700
is right here.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.220
You have the tally, too.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.140
Will you please tell your men

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.980
to sheathe their swords?

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.300
(Arsenal Bureau)

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.700
Oh, those dawdlers.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.140
I'll count to three!

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.580
Come out, or you'll be starved!

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.980
One!

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.300
Two!

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.540
Some honored guests are here.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.900
We must not

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.380
be discourteous.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.140
I'm Lu Qiba, the deputy commander.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.820
All these officers and I are here

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.060
to welcome the Marquis of Zhenguo.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.460
Welcome, Your Lordship.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.900
Come in, please.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.300
General Song,

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.820
we don't have

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.260
too many teacups.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.140
We only have two.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.260
So, I won't invite you in.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.620
What a sunny day today.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.100
Get some sunlight.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.420
It's good for growth.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.540
Where is the tea?

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.100
Come on.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.260
There's no tea.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.620
You've got a lot of good tea

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.480
in your home.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.370
Isn't that enough?

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.220
There's no need

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.060
to have bad tea here.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.140
Thank you for that.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.540
Don't mention it.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.980
The two of us

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.020
have gone through thick and thin.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.700
I would surely help you

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.660
instead of an outsider.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.800
Now, Song Shilan

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.980
is in charge of the defense.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.460
You just offended him.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.490
What if he gives you a hard time?

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.660
I've never feared anyone.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.940
When you first broke in here,

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.460
I gave you a good lesson.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.220
He...

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.900
But I...

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.380
I'm worried about you.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.140
Will you really stay here

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.020
without protest

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.220
and leave your beautiful sweetheart

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.460
in your mansion?

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.700
According to Song Shilan,

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.020
it'll be quite some time

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.580
before His Majesty allows you

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.580
to leave this place.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.820
I won't be staying here for long.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.020
(Gu Mansion)

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.020
Master,

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.780
today, General Song
escorted Young Marquis Wei

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:34.860
to the Arsenal Bureau,

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.260
at the order of His Majesty.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.580
His Majesty actually did that.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.900
So he's getting impatient.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.540
Master,

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.700
what do you mean?

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.260
Give this invitation to Chu Yu.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.660
(Invitation)

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.980
(Peace)

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.740
Was this invitation

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:13.940
from Zhang Deng?

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.130
He said it was Chancellor Gu's birthday,

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.700
and he invited you to his mansion

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.820
for a birthday banquet.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.740
Right now in the court,

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.300
Chancellor Gu may not be

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.340
the most powerful official.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:27.620
But after all,

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.620
he's of a high status.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:30.860
My Lady,

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.380
can you not go?

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.180
I have to go.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.300
Obviously he knew

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.320
Young Marquis wasn't

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.620
in town for the moment,

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.860
so he invited you.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:43.580
My Lady,

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:44.620
if you go like that,

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.740
you'll be walking into his trap.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.530
(Chu Yu, it's my birthday.)

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:50.520
(Come and talk to me.)

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.940
(I'll be waiting. By Gu Chusheng.)

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.300
General Song couldn't have gained

00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.420
His Majesty's trust

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.860
without Gu Chusheng's recommendation.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.020
Yun is confined in the Arsenal Bureau.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:05.860
He must

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.500
have something to do with it.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:09.980
Today, he wanted to see me.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:11.740
Good.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.380
I'll go and see

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.260
if he's a friend or foe.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.380
But My Lady,

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.620
it's obviously an ambush.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.500
If you go,

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.220
won't it be too dangerous?

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.100
He didn't try to kill Wei Yun.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.900
So, he wouldn't try to kill me.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:30.780
I don't even fear death.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.620
Why would I fear his schemes?

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.380
My Lady, let me go with you.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:40.740
Oh, no.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.500
I must go back to the Chu family

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.340
to seek help.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:10.580
Jin.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.780
What are you going to do?

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:20.700
Trust me.

Done.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.740
What's this?

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:10.580
Guelder rose.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.220
I learned it for you.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:14.220
Do you like it?

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.060
Why this flower?

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.140
I read many books back home,

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.980
and finally chose the guelder rose,

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.380
fascinating and vital.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.100
Because in my eyes,

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:26.700
this flower

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:27.980
is just like you,

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:28.820
my girl.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.220
Thank you.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.260
I like it very much.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.740
Come on. Let's open the shop.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:42.580
Let's go.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.060
(Invitation)

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:17.500
(Wei Yun,)

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:19.620
(when)

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.500
(will all this finish?)

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:30.140
(Gu Mansion)

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.180
Ms. Chu,

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.020
come in, please.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.740
Why is no one else here

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:46.740
for his birthday banquet?

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.220
He only invited you

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.660
to his banquet.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:50.820
What does it mean?

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:53.620
He doesn't want to be disturbed.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.220
If you come to seek something,

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:56.260
just follow me.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:07.580
(Gu Mansion)

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.300
(Gu Mansion)

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.260
Madams, please stop.

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:23.460
Chancellor Gu ordered

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.300
he wouldn't see anyone.
- He wouldn't?

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:26.740
Isn't it

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.140
his birthday banquet?

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.300
We'll congratulate him.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:30.700
He gave an order.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.060
From today, no one can get in

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.220
without permission.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.180
(Gu Mansion)

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:40.220
Don't do that.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.260
Come with me.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:45.500
Listen.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.540
What if his birthday banquet

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.540
is a mere guise?

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.300
He has tricked Her Ladyship

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:51.140
into his mansion.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.580
What will he do to her?

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.620
I'm Chu Jin.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.060
You've been working hard.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:05.740
Now, I have something urgent.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.860
Can you make an exception and let me in?

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.580
The order must not be violated.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:10.860
If you keep lingering,

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.660
we'll have to use force.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:14.540
What are you doing?

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.860
We've lost contact with Her Ladyship

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:17.740
since she came here.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:18.590
Now, you even dare

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:19.860
to threaten her sister.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:20.990
Perhaps I should

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:22.300
use force.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:23.460
Oh, Wanyue.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:26.940
Let's go.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.300
Are you alright?

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.140
I'm fine.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.980
Let's try another way to get in.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:57.500
There you are.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.180
If you invite me over

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.420
just to show me this,

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:04.820
I will not stay.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.180
You can't get out.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:15.620
From this moment on,

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:17.900
without my order,

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.260
you will not get out of here.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.660
You think you can trap me here

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.100
just as you like

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.780
because you're the Chancellor?

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.180
You know perfectly well

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:39.740
whether I am capable of this.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:49.740
Yu,

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:52.580
you're scared.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.300
Every time you're scared,

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:56.860
you clench your fists.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.380
When you're happy,

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.100
you like to sing

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.620
tuneless songs.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.640
I know you try to be strong.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.500
During the nights in the southwest,

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.940
you cried, missing your parents.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.300
I know you fight hard

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.340
in battles.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.180
But when a hedgehog

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.020
died in the field,

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.700
you built a grave for it.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:21.940
I still remember

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.820
when you were exhausted,

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.260
you would sleep talk.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.300
Yu,

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.180
I've seen every part of you.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.340
In this world,

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.260
I love you the most.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:41.460
So...

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.540
This is what we can talk about?

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:51.940
(To Gu Chusheng)
These are

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.820
all the letters you wrote to me.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:56.980
I've been keeping them.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.540
I've never forgotten you.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:01.940
Wei Yun can't protect you.

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.460
But I can.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.780
I can always protect you,

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.580
if you accept me.

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.580
I won't.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.340
(To Gu Chusheng)

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:27.780
No.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.460
Don't do this.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.060
Yu,

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.260
even if you don't trust me,

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.060
you shouldn't trample.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.260
You know how important

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.100
they are to me.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:52.260
Trample?

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:55.780
Fine.

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.460
Let me tell you a story.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:00.820
You'll see what "trample" means.

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.780
There was a young lady.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.220
She fell in love with a man.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.940
That man fell and was exiled.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.840
Then, she gave up

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.020
her stable life,

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.540
followed him to the distance,

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:21.860
and went through everything with him.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.300
Didn't she sacrifice?

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:29.740
If she didn't...

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.180
Then, she spent all her money,

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:35.820
and protected him on the border

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:37.620
for five years,

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.460
relying on her martial arts.

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.420
Didn't he owe her?

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.340
Her father was in trouble.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.060
She begged that man,

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:51.860
only to know

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.740
he married another woman

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.460
from a noble family.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:00.660
Gu Chusheng,

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.340
I'd like to ask you.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.740
Who exactly trampled?

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.380
What if I were to trample on you today?

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.550
When the day breaks,

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.180
the news that you stay here overnight

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.580
will spread throughout the city.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.020
Then, you'll have to marry me.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.300
Gu Chusheng, you're so despicable.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:32.300
Chu Yu,

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.300
do you think I'm still

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.100
the guilty man exiled in the southwest?

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.220
I gave an order.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.180
Let alone Chu Jin and ladies

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.020
from the Wei family,

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.300
even Wei Yun himself

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.700
can't break out of the Arsenal Bureau

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.950
to save you.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:57.700
Gu Chusheng,

00:20:58.540 --> 00:20:59.540
don't threaten me.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.340
Do you really think

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.180
I wouldn't kill you?

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.300
Kill me.

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.540
If you kill me,

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.740
you will never forget me.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.180
It's worth it.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:31.380
Gu Chusheng,

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:32.420
don't force it.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.420
I can't force it?

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.060
But I insist!

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:46.620
Gu Chusheng.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.220
What on earth

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.100
do you want,

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.260
my body or my love?

00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.860
If you want my love,

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:02.580
I'm afraid

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.020
I can't give it to you.

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:07.460
If you want my body,

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:09.700
you can take it now.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:27.900
Yu,

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.740
I just want you to live.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:39.060
Gu Chusheng,

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.700
look into my eyes and tell me.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:43.460
Why on earth

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.810
did you get me here?

00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.380
Your Majesty,

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.540
Wei Yun is devoted to our country.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.020
He's also been loyal

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.460
to Your Majesty.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:05.820
Lady Zhaohua

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:07.740
risked her life to defend Fengling.

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.340
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:10.940
I've made up my mind.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.540
Chu Yu is the reason

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.220
that Wei Yun defies me.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:16.540
Since he can't

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:17.460
cut off their bond,

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.540
I will help him.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:21.580
Your Majesty.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.300
If Your Majesty

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.180
insists on solving this problem,

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.700
I have an idea.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.740
It can keep them alive

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.460
and make sure

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.700
they won't be together.

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.780
Please approve!

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.460
So, this is why

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.340
you want to trap me here.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:42.700
Your injury...

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:44.860
It's alright.

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:49.820
Why does His Majesty think

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.780
Wei Yun will rebel?

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:53.380
Why wouldn't he?

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:55.540
For you,

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.660
he defied His Majesty many times.

00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.820
He made great contributions.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:00.920
But since ancient times,

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:02.260
who would end up well

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.260
after achieving too much?

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.020
After tonight,

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.300
even if you hate me

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.340
and people curse me,

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.100
I don't care.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.100
I just want you to live.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:19.820
So, His Majesty worries

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.220
that I may hinder Wei Yun.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.140
So, he wants to kill me.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.180
As long as you come back to me,

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:28.780
you and Wei Yun can live.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:32.740
I know you hate me.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:34.940
But as long as you discard Wei Yun,

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:36.940
the two of you will live.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.180
Since you understand me,

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:41.340
you should know I'm straight

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:42.340
and won't compromise.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.220
If I shrink like this just to be alive,

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:47.420
it proves

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.540
there's no justice in this world.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:51.820
Then, nothing is worth staying for.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.660
I appreciate that you want

00:24:58.820 --> 00:24:59.660
to protect me.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:02.380
But I'll solve my own problem.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:05.360
Do you remember?

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.140
We were watching the starry sky

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.660
in the southwest,

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.380
you told me about your dream.

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.740
"One day, I'll be an important official

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.500
and settle all the injustice

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.700
evilness, and poverty

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:20.100
in and outside

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.300
the court.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.260
I will make a peaceful world

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.340
for the people."

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.980
He doesn't want to be
an emotionless god.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.540
You don't want to be a stuffy official.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:35.700
It's been five years

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:36.940
and things have changed.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:41.060
But I hope you'll stay true
to your original dream

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:42.940
and march with passion

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:44.540
in this vast world.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.300
His Majesty hasn't given up
on the Eldest Princess.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:04.820
Officials hold different attitudes

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.020
towards Her Highness.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:07.860
His Majesty cares a lot about her.

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:09.740
I know

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.100
you are close to Her Highness.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:12.980
You must want her back.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:15.740
Yu,

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.380
sometimes we can benefit

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.460
when contributing to the country.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:26.140
Thank you.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:35.140
I don't think

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.140
this will help.

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:37.740
We need to think

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:38.860
of another way

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:39.860
and get in.

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.500
- Yu.
- My Lady.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.940
(Gu Mansion)

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.140
Jin, Wanyue.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:51.660
You...

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:53.460
Yu, are you alright?

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.620
My Lady,

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:55.500
did Gu Chusheng

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.620
do anything to you?

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.020
I'm fine.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.140
Why are you here?

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:00.780
We're worried about you.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:02.020
It's my fault.

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.300
I failed to get in there.

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:04.860
Gu Chusheng is terrible.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.100
Did he bully you?

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.660
No. He didn't do anything.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.300
Glad you're here.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:13.660
Yu, don't be scared.

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:15.260
No matter what happens,

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:16.380
I'll be there for you.

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:17.780
And me.

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:19.460
I will also

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:20.700
stay by your side.

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.620
With you around,

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:30.860
I won't be scared of anything.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.140
(Who did I climb up with?)

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.420
(I always remember that autumn.)

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:21.940
(What's gone is gone.)

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.380
(And it's just like a dream.)

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:29.460
Chu Yu,

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:30.980
I will live up to your trust

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:32.900
and fulfill my dream.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.220
If you want a peaceful world,

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.340
I will always protect this peace.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:54.540
(Chengqing Gate)

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:06.940
(Chengqing Gate)

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:14.660
Your Lordship,

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:15.940
Ms. Chu is in trouble.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.060
Your Lordship!

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:18.980
Your Lordship!

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.540
Your Lordship,

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:24.420
Ms. Chu is in trouble!

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:25.580
Ms. Chu is in trouble!

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:26.500
Stop yelling.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.340
He can't hear you.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.860
Your Lordship, come out!

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:30.940
Ms. Chu is in trouble!

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.700
Who said I couldn't hear?

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.980
(Arsenal Bureau)

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:54.220
Your Lordship,

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.100
Ms. Chu is in trouble.

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:56.420
Early this morning,

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.580
she headed for the palace.

00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.220
You must do something.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:02.980
If you take one more step forward,

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:04.700
I will order

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:05.980
that you be killed here.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:07.680
Whoever stands in my way

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.220
will die.

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:17.340
(Arsenal Bureau)

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:57.540
You can't stop me.

00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.380
Why would I kill you?

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:01.260
General Song.

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.260
Do you really think

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:07.580
you can rein in this bureau?

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.340
Do you not remember

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:13.020
whose territory it is?

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:14.580
Commander Lu,

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:16.180
will you support him

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:17.700
in defying His Majesty?

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:21.980
He's my best friend.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.740
What if I risk my life for him?

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:29.420
Are you insane?

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:30.780
Will you really rebel?

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:31.860
General Song,

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.460
when I'm doing this,

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.060
His Majesty will be furious.

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.100
I'll tell His Majesty the truth

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:39.940
that I insist on breaking out.

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:41.820
You'll be proven innocent

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:43.180
and won't suffer.

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.620
Do you know, once you break out of here,

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.420
your merits, your reputation,

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.020
and the Wei's century-old prestige

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.540
will all be ruined.

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.060
If you're the next Marquis of Zhenguo,

00:31:58.540 --> 00:31:59.380
I'll be relieved.

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:07.700
Yun,

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.740
I've dreamed of pacifying the border

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:11.460
and guarding the nation like you.

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:13.820
Is it worth it for a woman?

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.420
I'm a Wei.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:18.660
I protect the nation and its people.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:20.740
But I will not

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:21.940
discard Chu Yu

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.060
for the people.

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.780
Even if this is an impossible situation,

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:30.900
I will defy destiny

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:32.380
and only protect her.

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.540
Chu Yu requests to see His Majesty.

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.460
(Chengqing Gate)

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.460
Chu Yu requests to see His Majesty.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.220
Oh, Lady Zhaohua.

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:16.260
Lady Zhaohua,

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:17.940
His Majesty has heard the drum.

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.940
What grievance do you wish to plead?

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.540
I do have a grievance.

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:24.340
I want to accuse His Majesty.

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:27.540
How dare you, Chu Yu?

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.100
How could you defy His Majesty?

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:31.340
What punishment
do you think you deserve?

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.580
Dengwen Drum is set for the people.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:35.540
Anyone can beat it for injustice.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:37.620
I've risked my life

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.420
for our country.

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:40.940
His Majesty binds me

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:42.220
for the rest of my life

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:43.940
by making me Lady Zhaohua.

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:47.180
To me, this is an injustice.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:49.700
Can I

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:50.890
not accuse him just because

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:53.060
he's the Emperor?

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:54.620
You...

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:57.700
Lady Zhaohua,

00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:59.740
do you know, by law,

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:03.060
anyone, common or noble,
must be caned 20 times

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.980
before he or she can report a grievance?

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:08.380
I'm willing to be caned.

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.660
I request to see His Majesty.

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.330
Young Marquis Wei and Lady Zhaohua

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:17.180
just achieved merits.

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:18.540
Why have they both defied

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:19.810
and angered His Majesty?

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:21.540
I'm afraid Lady Zhaohua

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:23.020
will lose her life today.

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.140
Yeah.

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:27.920
(Chengqing Gate)
Start.

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:28.780
Yes.

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:33.860
One.

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:38.140
Two.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:41.820
Three.

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:45.260
Four.

00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:48.020
Five.

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:50.300
Six.

00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:53.020
Seven.

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:55.460
Eight.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:57.900
Nine.

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:02.540
Ten.

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:11.540
Lady Zhaohua,

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:12.860
it's half done.

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.140
His Majesty has spoken.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:16.700
For the sake of your merits,

00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:18.100
the ten floggings

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:19.940
would be a small punishment.

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.860
If you go back right now,

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.020
His Majesty will let it go,

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:25.140
show mercy,

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:28.180
and spare you from your defiance.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.540
Unless His Majesty withdraws it,

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:35.300
I'll keep defying that order.

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.340
As a subject of His Majesty,

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:40.900
I keep faith with the people.

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:43.060
I accept punishment for errors

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:44.980
and torture for crimes.

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:46.980
I'm willing to accept

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:49.660
the 20 floggings.

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:52.860
Lady Zhaohua,

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:54.300
why don't you get that?

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:56.660
You must not defy His Majesty.

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:58.420
Do you know what will happen to you?

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:02.580
Please tell me

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:04.460
what will happen to me.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:13.740
Today,

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:16.060
even if I'm beaten to death here,

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:18.340
after the flogging,

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:20.380
by law,

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:22.660
you should take my dead body

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:23.740
before His Majesty.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:28.740
Continue.

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.380
Eleven.

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:49.940
I married "Wei Jun"...

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:50.780
Twelve.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:53.980
To find out the truth

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:55.540
and avenge my father.

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:57.540
I'm not wrong.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:58.420
Thirteen.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.540
Wen Yun and I

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:01.660
- Fourteen.
- love each other.

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:05.620
I'm not wrong, either.

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:06.700
Fifteen.

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:09.660
Sixteen.

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.380
If the world is cruel...

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:15.380
Seventeen.

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.380
If the destiny is unfair...

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:18.380
Eighteen.

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:20.340
Why

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:23.180
can't I

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.700
fight for myself?

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:25.860
Nineteen.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:38.580
Twenty.

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.260
Yu.

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.380
Sorry, I'm late.

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:54.820
Why are you here?

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:58.260
Your Lordship,

00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.820
without His Majesty's decree,

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.700
how could you break out?

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:12.860
Were you trying to kill her?

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.420
Help me get up.

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:22.700
Yu.

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.500
The flogging is done.

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.300
Chu Yu requests to see His Majesty.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:42.660
I'm Wei Yun.

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.420
I request to see His Majesty with her.

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:51.940
No matter how hard

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:53.660
or how dangerous,

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.140
even if everyone curses me

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:00.020
and even if I die,

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:01.900
I will be with you.

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:13.580
Alright.

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.300
The two of you defied my order.

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:51.300
Are you trying to rebel?

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.060
Your Majesty,

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.620
I don't accept the honorary title.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.180
My heart belongs to no one

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:08.740
but Wei Yun.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.860
- Your Majesty.
- Wei Yun.

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:21.660
Think before you speak.

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:23.620
After the war in Qingzhou,

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:26.500
the two nations have come to a detente.

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:27.900
If a war breaks out,

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:29.220
General of the West

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:30.340
can fight enemies

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:31.180
on your behalf.

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:32.860
Right now, in our country,

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.380
you are not the only general

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:37.860
who can fight the war.

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:47.580
Your Majesty,

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.380
I can always be a loyal general.

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:51.940
But if you want me

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.860
to be the peerless God of War,

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.060
I will not do it.

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:02.500
A god has no heart, but a man does.

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:05.340
And that is why

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:07.100
I fight for this country.

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:08.700
That is why I defend

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:10.460
our nation,

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:11.820
our Emperor,

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:15.740
and the one I love

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:20.100
for a lifetime.

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:29.980
Your Majesty,

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:32.380
all that happened was my fault.

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:35.220
I will bear all the consequences.

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:36.620
I can lose my title

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:37.820
or secure the border.

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:39.780
Your Majesty,

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.420
please grant me a second chance

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:43.460
to atone for my mistake

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:45.580
and punish no one else.

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:52.860
Your Majesty,

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:55.220
the two countries

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:58.460
have agreed to a truce

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:01.020
and the new king has just ascended.

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.260
But a definitive conclusion
regarding peace or war

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:05.820
remains to be reached.

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:08.140
Is there any official

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:09.700
brave enough

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.460
to lead a delegation to North Qi?

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:26.340
Many people are afraid of death.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:28.220
But I'm not afraid.

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:32.300
I voluntarily request

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:34.660
to lead a delegation to North Qi

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.700
and fulfill Your Majesty's wish.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.060
If I succeed in the peace talks
and return safely,

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:45.300
I hope Your Majesty
will withdraw your order

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:46.740
and let me be with Wei Yun.

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:48.780
If I fail,

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:51.620
punish me as you please.
