00:02:02.573 --> 00:02:04.110
(I was talking about the car, not you.)

(Gu Yejia, I was wrong.)

00:02:12.017 --> 00:02:13.550
(I was talking about the car, not you.)

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.740
(The car... Gu Yejia...)

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.980
Yu Yu.

00:02:46.684 --> 00:02:48.795
I really wasn't talking
about you just now.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.270
I'm not that upset.

00:02:51.417 --> 00:02:54.506
It's just that the way you speak
can be really embarrassing sometimes.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.860
No.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.020
I didn't hear any of that.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.830
All I heard was something
about a car rusting.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.990
I didn't know anything else.

00:03:01.017 --> 00:03:02.550
So I'm talking about the car, not you.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.740
And you actually

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.230
still look

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:07.790
pretty young.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.230
What do you mean by "look"?

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.300
Oh, I mean, you really are young.

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:17.830
Why are you standing outside?

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.510
Come on in and join us.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.070
Coffee this late at night?

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.510
Don't you want a drink to loosen up?

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.070
This is my friend's place.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.900
This is the owner, Mr. Li.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.260
Li Huaiqing.

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:39.390
How should I address you?

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.070
Hello, I'm Gu Yejia.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.460
Oh, Miss Gu.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.580
Your friend?

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.350
Ah, yes.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.350
I'm his friend.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.350
Oh, really?

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.350
You guys chat.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.460
Alright.

00:04:05.751 --> 00:04:07.110
Have you ever been to Africa?

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.510
Ah?

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:11.620
No.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.700
I think you're great.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.180
Ah?

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.070
Come by more often.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.551
Have you been to our shop before?

00:04:20.062 --> 00:04:21.710
It's fine. Feel free to come anytime.

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:22.550
Okay.

00:04:24.195 --> 00:04:25.990
"The Great Escape" Collector's Edition.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.990
It's for you.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.500
Don't you have other things to do?

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.550
You're the only table of guests tonight.

00:04:36.795 --> 00:04:38.620
Then go find something else
to keep busy.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.470
Need help?

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.620
No, thank you.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.470
Alright then.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.990
Why are you giving me this?

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.300
Consider it

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.150
a little gift between friends.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.017
You don't have
to give me anything in return.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.110
It can also be my way of making amends.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.470
"Making amends" includes
both manners and etiquette.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:05.910
It also implies a gift.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.710
Well, thank you then.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.990
Who even watches DVDs these days?

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.670
Oh, this isn't a DVD.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:16.670
Come with me.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.500
These are all Blu-ray movies.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.820
You can buy or rent them.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.380
What era is this?

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.217
Does anyone even watch discs anymore?

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.640
Just because you don't watch them
doesn't mean no one does.

00:05:28.684 --> 00:05:29.462
Let me tell you,

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:31.060
every field has its enthusiasts.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.300
These enthusiasts

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.030
would spend 99% more money

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.670
for just a one percent improvement.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.380
Enthusiasts? What do you mean?

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.150
They're hobbyists.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.817
They go all out on all sorts of gadgets.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.620
Blu-ray movies like these

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.500
are a favorite
among audio-visual enthusiasts.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.860
Then what am I supposed to use

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.060
to watch this disc?

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.590
I don't have a player at home.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.350
Can I use my laptop?

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.670
A laptop's screen is

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:56.670
just A4-sized.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.773
You use it to watch films?

00:05:57.817 --> 00:06:01.030
There's an idiom called wasting heaven's
gifts and that's exactly what this is.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.820
You've been to a cinema before.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.973
You should know
that the bigger the screen, the better.

00:06:05.884 --> 00:06:07.595
Then what do you
usually use to watch them?

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.620
I use a Blu-ray player

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:09.790
and a big projector.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.790
These were all shot on film.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.470
You need a large projector

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.860
to really show their texture.

00:06:14.884 --> 00:06:15.990
And the sense of ceremony.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.990
Okay, I'll buy one tomorrow.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.230
Alright.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.150
Where can I get one?

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.230
I have one here.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.110
We never discount anything here.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.710
Since you're his friend,

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.550
I'll give you 30% off. Is that okay?

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.620
Ah...

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.300
Thank you.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.710

My hand is fine,
so you can take off the bandage.

00:07:54.262 --> 00:07:56.230
Bandages should be removed
in the surgery department.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:57.400
I think you're more reliable.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.740
Actually, your hand
didn't even need a bandage.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:02.300

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.110
If it weren't for you,

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.590
I wouldn't have spent so much.

00:08:29.417 --> 00:08:31.150
You really take advantage
of your friends.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:31.990
You bought a TV?

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:33.270

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:35.230

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:40.110
I like watching ads.

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.470
Hmph, you must regret it,

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.470
but won't admit it.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:47.430
You can leave now.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.430

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.710
Much better.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:57.350

- Yes.

Yes.

The movie I gave you, did you like it?

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.990
Yes, it was good.

gave you "The Great Escape,"

did you finish it?

00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.540
That movie?

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.310
I fell asleep in less than ten minutes.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.150
Oh really?

You liar.

And you told me it was good.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.260
I was just being polite.

How is this not bad?

00:11:22.706 --> 00:11:23.740
It's not that big either.

Oh, you want a bigger one.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:26.950
Got it.

You're thinking,
what if you accidentally get married

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:31.310
and have to live with that man, right?

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:35.430
What do you mean
"accidentally get married"?

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:37.860

You're a top designer.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.830
But I've always wondered,

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.710
for such a famous designer like you,

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:47.590
why live in such a small place?

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.660
And it's not soundproof.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:49.500
Oh.

That's an exception.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:10.830
He's the exception, or are you?

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:15.030
Oh right.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.140

of "The Great Escape."

We can't accept gifts from patients.

Dao?

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.710
Is that Mr. Yu's nickname?

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:57.070
Yes.

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.380
He was originally called Yu Dedao.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.860
Pretty good name, right?

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.430
But when he grew up,

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:05.500
he thought it didn't fit
his designer identity,

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.260
so he changed it to Yu Yu.

Yu Yu, hear it.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:11.310
Sounds like a coachman, right?

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:13.740
Dao is still cute.

Isn't he introverted in front of you?

quite well in his career.

No need, thank you.

Oh dear.

Measure your blood pressure at home,

Nothing much.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.950
It's not serious.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.950
Alright.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.470
Bro, why aren't you saying anything?

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:56.950
I don't borrow money from others,
and I don't lend either.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:59.070
Why say it twice?

00:15:59.106 --> 00:16:00.110
Think about it yourself.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:02.190
Lend me some?

00:16:02.217 --> 00:16:04.217
I'm having
a financial crisis this month.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.220
Why borrow again?

00:16:06.284 --> 00:16:07.551
Isn't it your sister's fault?

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:10.230
She only gives me
2,000 pocket money a month.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:12.540
2,000 is not that little.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.860
In New Guinea,
that could save a whole tribe.

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:19.190
Actually, there are many
wonderful things in life

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:20.470
that you wouldn't expect.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:21.550
Ah?

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.470
But most of them
require money to experience.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:25.310
Stop.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.590
No need to show off
your single life to me.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.070
Just say it, will you lend or not?

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:34.670
Alright.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.840
Then I'll tell Mom

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.900
that you keep going
to the hospital to see Gu Yejia.

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:47.660
Alright, I'll give it to you later.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.020
Thanks, my dear brother.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:52.860
What are you two doing?

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:53.884
Aren't you going to eat?

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.430
Nothing much, just...

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.217
I'll take him to wash his hands.

00:16:57.262 --> 00:17:00.100
Can you believe someone this grown-up
still doesn't like cleanliness?

00:17:00.106 --> 00:17:01.140
You'll lead him?

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.230
He never listens.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:05.230
Financial freedom isn't
about how much you earn,

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.060
but how much you can freely spend.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.100
For example,

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.430
I can spend 6,000 a month,

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:10.270
and you spend 3,000.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.284
Then I'm richer than you.

00:17:11.284 --> 00:17:12.950
Even if your monthly salary
is ten times mine.

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:13.790
Oh, bro,

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.580
stop your twisted logic.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:16.870
Let's eat.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.950
The money you earn
while single is truly yours.

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:24.470
After marriage,
your earnings get eaten up by your wife,

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:26.580
children, house, and car.

00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:27.430
Poor you.

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:29.740
If you want to give a speech,
go stand on TV and say it.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:30.740
We're eating here.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.740
What wife and kids spending money?

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.990
That's just an excuse
for not getting married.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:37.190
Listen to me,
you should get married too.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.630
You got married, and you
keep telling others to get married.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:41.710
Is marriage MLM?

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:43.060
Are you recruiting downlines?

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:44.510
Ignore him.

00:17:44.817 --> 00:17:46.470
His downline doesn't need recruiting.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:47.470
He'll marry soon.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.180
How do you know?

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:50.780
Which fortune teller told you that?

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:51.670
I want to report him.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.060
I'm telling you, Yejia is really great.

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:55.300
Good-looking,

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.262
has a great temperament,
and is well-mannered.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:58.500
Professionally decent.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.100
Mom likes her very much.

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:02.500
How do you know her?

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:05.260
You're so silly.

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:06.630
So convenient.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.020
Just introduce her to me directly.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.670
I won't lend the money. I'm telling you.

00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:14.390
You're borrowing from my brother again?

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.820
No, he's talking nonsense.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.230
Don't interrupt.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:19.580
I'm talking about Yejia.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.580
Yejia thinks very highly
of your brother.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.060
How so?

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.190
Outgoing.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:27.260
- Outgoing?
- Yes.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:28.150
That counts as a merit?

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:29.870
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.150
Oh, yes.

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:36.790
Foodie.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:39.060
What are you thinking?

00:18:40.617 --> 00:18:41.910
I'm not thinking about anything.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:43.870
I'm full. You can take your time.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.260
(Ten-thousand Dingmao Year Noodles)

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.190
Dr. Gu.

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:53.580
Oh, sorry.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.020
Could you please hold onto
the fan for me?

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.820
Do not send it by courier.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.300
I'll have my son pick it up personally.

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:02.190
Thanks a lot.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.230
I'll have my son
treat you to coffee then.

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:07.910
That's the situation.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.100
But I don't want to

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.060
see him again just for this fan.

00:19:11.106 --> 00:19:12.300
You can help me give it to him.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.300
Your homes are so close.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:15.150
I?

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.230
This fan is so valuable.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:18.580
Forget it, I'm poor anyway.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.540
If anything happens along the way,
I can't afford it.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:23.900
Moreover...

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.950
Auntie is just trying to set you two up.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.230
Oh, no way.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.500
If something happens

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.710
to the fan along the way,
I'll take responsibility.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:34.670
Please just help me
give it to him, okay?

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.470
I'm not helping with this favor.

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:44.380
(Yu Yu)

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.380
Hey.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:46.910
Look who's calling.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.580
Speak of the devil.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.300
Quick, answer it.

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:51.990
Speakerphone, I'll listen.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.340
Hello?

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:56.180
Done with work?

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:58.100
Yes.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.540
(Yu Yu)
Eating noodles right now?

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.617
If it's important, just say it.

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:09.190
My mom contacted you.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.390
Mm-hmm.

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:11.773
I don't have time tomorrow either.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.430
But if you really want me to see you...

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:16.430
It's not like I really want to meet you.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:18.260
You took my mom's fan.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.740
It's your mom who left it at my place.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.670
Here's the deal.
I'll give you three options.

00:20:23.951 --> 00:20:25.440
Option one, send me the address,

00:20:25.506 --> 00:20:26.730
and I'll send it via express.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.430
Option two,
you come pick it up yourself.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:30.950
Option three, get a third party to help.

00:20:31.062 --> 00:20:32.100
My noodles will get cold.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.710
Decide and tell me. Bye.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:37.470
Exactly, he's such a proud person.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:38.330
I'm telling you,

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.740
every time he speaks, I just...

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:41.750
Exactly.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:50.020
The hospital system told me

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.500
Mr. Yu Yu booked me for next Monday.

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:58.470
Okay.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.390
He's clever, choosing the fourth option.

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:03.190
I'll give him a call.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.260
What's up now?

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.500
If it's just about picking up the fan,

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.500
I suggest you cancel the appointment.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:14.870
Don't waste public resources.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.910
I'm off tomorrow.

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:16.750
I can meet you.

00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:18.670
I'm not insisting
on taking public resources,

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:19.870
nor insisting on seeing you.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.230
But if you really want to see me...

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.150
Fine, since you already made plans,

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.100
I won't be the go-between.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.670
It's getting late.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.260
I'm going to my part-time job.

00:21:33.395 --> 00:21:35.217
Since when did you
start a part-time job?

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:37.910
Long story.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:39.740
I'll tell you later. Gotta go.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:41.340
Bye, take care.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.340
The fan.

00:22:04.017 --> 00:22:05.740
Do you think
you can scare me every time?

00:22:05.995 --> 00:22:07.030
You actually did scare.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.540
Hey, can you stop
standing behind me all the time?

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.140
Sit down.

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:21.510
Wow.

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.030
Milk tea.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:28.910
Chocolate, sugar, pearls,
and coconut jelly.

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:30.710
How much do you weigh?

00:22:31.728 --> 00:22:32.790
Mind your own business.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.950
Look at me,
my green drink is so healthy.

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:03.870
Your bag is really messy.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:06.750
What's this?

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:07.830
Which one?

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:09.100
This one.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.260
This spray is for hydration.

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.910
The relative humidity today is 64%.

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:16.300
Is your face a desert?

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.340
Such a big bag,
yet you pack so many useless things.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.150
Ugh, you're even more annoying today.

00:23:25.262 --> 00:23:27.506
I'm just trying to stop my mom
from getting her way.

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:36.230
I forgot the fan.

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:37.070
Ah?

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.870
Weren't you coming today
just to return the fan?

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:41.951
And you still forgot it?

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:44.950
I changed my jacket when I left.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:46.780
I put the fan in that jacket pocket.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.100
I didn't put it in my bag.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.060
Alright.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:49.990
With your bag,

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.260
you would forget it
even if it was inside.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:54.900
Look at mine.

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:57.740
It has compartments.

00:23:57.906 --> 00:24:00.020
Everything is clearly organized
and easy to find.

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:01.910
This pocket is for a notebook.

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.190
This one is for a wallet.

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:07.470
Everything has its place.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.500
I suggest you get the same one as mine.

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:13.190
Or better, get one for Auntie too.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.710
She has the same problem as I.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.300
She's forgetful.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.830
Goodbye.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.100
Green means health.

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:33.230
I won't.

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:47.500
Morning, Ms. Lin.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.340
Morning.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:49.420
What's up?

00:24:50.284 --> 00:24:51.670
Hit the tennis ball too far?

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.990
I was the one who threw it.

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:59.260
My love life is all sweet,
no bitterness.

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:00.420
Hmph.

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.470
Then next time, try baseball.

00:25:02.795 --> 00:25:03.950
Enough with the ball talk.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:06.580
You really think
a breakup would upset me?

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:07.550
Fine.

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:09.470
The client has another problem.

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.500
The client lost their job.

00:25:12.751 --> 00:25:14.300
They want to cut the budget by 50,000.

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:15.510
Ah?

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:16.510
What?

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:18.820
I already finished the design.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.240
Now they tell me they have no money.

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.260
They suddenly lost their job

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.340
and can't spend too much.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:24.950
Then get another job.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:26.820
Easier said than done.

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:29.060
Nothing in the adult world comes easy.

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:32.300
Easy to go bald,
gain weight, or go broke.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.390
Hard to find a wife too.

00:25:34.395 --> 00:25:36.020
Mature people either learn to compliment

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:36.870
or learn to shut up.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:38.260
You're fine just the way you are.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.910
Mr. Yu, how about we leave
this kitchen wall as it is?

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:46.580
If we don't knock it down,
it should save 50,000.

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:48.260
Yeah, isn't that great?

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:50.060
It won't affect your design either.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:53.300
If you're so casual about it,

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.780
then hire another designer.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:56.630
Why hire me?

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.670
One small compromise
won't affect your design vision.

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:02.390
No, let him find someone else.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:03.820
Come on, Mr. Yu.

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:05.990
Are you really going to
give up 250,000 for 50,000?

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:07.870
If we do that,
we won't get a single cent.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.230
It's about my principle.

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:10.670
It's about my survival.

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:11.740
I make the call here.

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:13.740
Please, Mr. Yu.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:14.580
If we do this,

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:15.950
I won't even get my commission.

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:17.340
I'll have no money for dating.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:18.340
Hmph.

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:21.340
Dating two girls
takes double the effort.

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:24.190
Hey. You have
other girls besides Xiaoxiao?

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:25.060
No, really not.

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.240
Mr. Yu, why are you saying that?

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:26.840
You swear.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:27.506
I swear.

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:30.990
Hello.

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:32.860
Okay, I'll get it.

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:40.780
Hello, Mr. Yu, your package.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:41.620
Thanks.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.420
The Sims, Master Chess.

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:47.270
What is this?

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:48.620
The Sims.

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:49.950
A variant of Master Chess.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.470
Designed in 1972.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:52.910
Published in 1979.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:54.120
How much?

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:54.990
Over a thousand.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:55.850
So expensive.

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:56.700
Ah?

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.190
He's so poor,
and you're still spending like crazy.

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:01.260
His poverty is none of my business.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.100
I'm not his father.

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:03.540
Even if I were,

00:27:03.551 --> 00:27:05.951
the inheritance I leave
would be my leftover money.

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.328
I mean, buy this junk

00:27:08.351 --> 00:27:09.670
and play it by yourself...

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:11.580
Mature people either learn to compliment

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.060
or learn to shut up.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:16.710
Good.

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:22.630
- Oh no.
- What happened?

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:23.990
An emergency.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.260
Do you have ten thousand?

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:27.430
No cash.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:29.190
You can use my credit card,

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:30.773
but pay the card payment next month.

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.260
I can't pay next month either.

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.230
What happened? Another mess?

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.580
That house is my uncle's.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:42.190
Today, the property management
called me.

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:44.230
Turns out
I have to pay the property fee.

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:45.580
4,000 per month.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.060
I already owe three months.

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.340
What property fee?

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:49.540
4,000 a month?

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:51.780
Three months make 12,000.

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.190
12,000 isn't the problem.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:54.670
The issue is 4,000 per month.

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:57.300
How can I pay for that on my salary?

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:59.870
You know how I spend my money.

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:00.910
I use Huabei and Jiebei,

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:02.430
and swap between them.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:04.630
Robbing Peter to pay Paul.

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:06.470
Now the wall collapsed.

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:08.060
You got what you deserved.

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.230
Look at you.
400 for earrings, 800 for foundation,

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.950
and 80 for socks.

00:28:12.017 --> 00:28:13.340
Luckily, we have work uniforms.

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:14.500
Otherwise, you'd be bankrupt.

00:28:14.595 --> 00:28:15.910
It's not reckless spending.

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:16.910
It's affordable luxury.

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.950
Affordable luxury is just fancy poverty.

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:21.390
It's a scam for fools like you.

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.540
There are just too many cute things.

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:27.780
I swear I won't spend recklessly again.

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.430
But even that won't help.

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:32.990
I bought it in installments,

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:34.630
and I still pay every month.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.490
Mm.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:37.990
Yeah, just accept your fate.

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:39.230
There's nothing I can do.

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:56.740
Good evening.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:57.580
Mm.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.430
Can I ask you something?

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:03.780
A simple answer.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.500
Do you pay property fees
for this house every month?

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:09.580
Yes.

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:10.920
- How much?
- 1,000.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:12.910
1,000?

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:14.706
Why is it 1,000 for you
but 4,000 for me?

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.710
I told you, simple answer.

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:19.540
Isn't this house your uncle's?

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:20.500
Why not ask him?

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:31.780
Stop showing off. It's annoying.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:56.740
(Bill)

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.380
(Congratulations, you're married.)

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:35.470
Alas...

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:38.870
Marriage is always a chain.

00:30:40.195 --> 00:30:41.660
(Congratulations, you own a villa.)

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:51.260
Your wife requests an increase
in household expenses.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.830
Decline.

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.620
(Congratulations, you're married.)

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:14.340
Your wife left you.

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:15.910
You never recover.

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:17.020
Depressed and unhappy.

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:18.150
Bad ending.

00:31:19.128 --> 00:31:20.973
Does getting married
always lead to trouble?

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.100
(Tragic ending)
I'm done.

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:27.820
(The client lost their job.)

00:31:27.995 --> 00:31:29.751
(Option A: Total renovation 250,000)
(He wants to cut 50,000.)

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.380
(Option B: Closed kitchen,
total renovation 200,000)

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:33.710
(I already finished the design.)

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:35.260
(Option A: Open kitchen)
(Now they say they have no money?)

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.630
(They suddenly lost their job)

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:38.150
(and can't overspend.)

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:39.950
(Then get another job.)

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:41.670
(Easier said than done.)

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.780
(Adults' lives aren't that simple.)

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:47.340
(Closed kitchen)
(How about we leave this wall as is?)

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:49.780
(Leaving it saves 50,000.)

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:52.660
(Total renovation 200,000)
(It's about my principle.)

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:00.528
(Option B: Moved to trash)

00:32:00.573 --> 00:32:02.750
(Option A: Open kitchen,
total renovation 250,000)

00:32:09.506 --> 00:32:11.580
We still need to confirm this plan
with the client.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:12.630
Okay, no problem.

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:13.630
Ms. Lin.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:14.910
No problem.

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:15.750
Here.

00:32:15.773 --> 00:32:18.284
This is the design draft Mr. Yu
asked me to deliver personally.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:21.260
Delivering the draft or seeing Xiaoxiao?

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:23.260
Well, it's on the way.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.230
He actually changed the design.

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:35.430
Isn't this still the original design?

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:36.540
Printed so beautifully too.

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:37.430
Is he crazy?

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:38.420
Hmph.

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:40.710
Make them regret it
every time they see it.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.150
That's exactly what Mr. Yu said.

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:44.950
How old is he? Really...

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:56.630
But this design does look pretty good.

00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.340
Pretty, yes.

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:01.260
But the client's budget isn't enough.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:02.300
There's nothing we can do.

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.580
Well, honestly speaking,

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:05.950
if it were me,

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:07.910
I'd definitely choose
the open-plan design.

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.670
If everyone were as rich as you,

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:11.040
this wouldn't even be a problem.

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:13.670
But Ms. Lin...

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:14.510
Yes?

00:33:15.062 --> 00:33:16.884
How do you usually manage your finances?

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:17.910
Manage finances?

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.780
I can introduce you
to a financial advisor.

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:20.950
No need.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.573
A financial advisor wouldn't bother
with someone as broke as me.

00:33:23.573 --> 00:33:24.570
- Sis.
- Eh?

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.540
Someone sent you flowers again.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:29.630
Oh, put them
with the other two bouquets.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:30.950
Aren't you going to go take a look?

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:32.630
Downstairs, handsome guy.

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:34.580
If he's still here in an hour,

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:35.710
I'll go check him out.

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:40.540
Hey, who's this new guy, Ms. Lin?

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:42.100
Let me see.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.780
What kind of coach is he today?

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:45.340
What does that have to do with you?

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:47.100
Where is he?

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:48.710
Don't look. You can't see.

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:50.510
Come here.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:51.620
She's calling you.

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:57.060
Is something wrong with her?

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.180
Ah?

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:09.060
I told her you were dating another girl.

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.430
What are you clucking about?

00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:16.140
- You have...
- Who do you think you are?

00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:18.990
Why are you spreading what Mr. Yu said?

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:20.351
Do you talk to the boss like that?

00:34:20.373 --> 00:34:21.060
Out.

00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:23.580
I'm really done with your blabbermouth!

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:24.670
Xiaoxiao.

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:26.470
Xiaoxiao.

00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:28.140
Serves you right for gossiping.

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:30.110
Alas...

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.950
Xia Xiaoman is Mr. Yu's neighbor.

00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:34.350
Mr. Yu was sick before.

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:36.140
She took him to the hospital.

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:37.700
I had dinner with her twice.

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:38.540
Twice?

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:40.700
You had dinner twice? Really?

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:42.220
The first time,

00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:44.500
I went to thank her
for taking Mr. Yu to the hospital.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:47.350
The second time was a big group dinner.

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:48.350
I just tagged along.

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:49.350
Not a date.

00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:51.830
You know my situation better than I do.

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:52.950
I don't.

00:34:52.973 --> 00:34:54.906
If it's too little for you,
you can switch jobs.

00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:56.790
Xiaoxiao.

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:01.750
I want to be a designer.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:03.830
Back in the old days,
I'd just be an apprentice.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:05.540
An apprentice is lucky to have food.

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:07.620
I get what you mean.

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:09.950
You want me to step out
of my comfort zone.

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:10.789
That's fine.

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:12.795
But you can't push me out
of my safety zone, right?

00:35:12.795 --> 00:35:13.660
Shen Wu.

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:16.240
You're just lazy like a pig.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.790
But you can't be lazy
like a pig and feel at ease.

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:20.140
Making excuses?

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:20.990
Well, forget it.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:22.180
Don't be mad, my bad.

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:23.551
Let's not talk about this, okay?

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:24.580
Change the topic.

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:30.100
Then tell me about Xia Xiaoman.

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.310
What's there to say about Xia Xiaoman?

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:34.580
Talk about Xia Xiaoman.

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:35.700
She's a woman.

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.430
In her twenties, about 1.7 meters tall.

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:39.830
One nose, two eyes, one mouth.

00:35:39.884 --> 00:35:40.860
Not prettier than you.

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:43.750
- I want to meet her.
- No problem.

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:50.950
Nice place.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.950
This is my girlfriend, Wang Xiaoxiao.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.020
Xia Xiaoman, Mr. Yu's neighbor.

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:37.390
1st, 12th.

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:38.620
Also Xueyin Liuguang, right?

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:41.910
You can tell just by looking?

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:43.470
Impressive.

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.420
What's this?

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:47.950
Loose powder shade.

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:48.790
Lipstick shade.

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:49.830
And perfume scent.

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:54.700
Enough. Based on this set,

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:57.140
you and Wu are innocent.

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:01.500
What do you mean by innocent?

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.020
Obviously.

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:05.620
You can't support her.

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.180
She doesn't fancy you.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.617
You looking down on someone,
Wang Xiaoxiao?

00:37:11.662 --> 00:37:12.270
What?

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:13.750
I really hate your reasoning.

00:37:13.973 --> 00:37:15.190
Who are you talking about?

00:37:15.973 --> 00:37:17.100
But I like your argument.

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:22.990
Though, I don't entirely agree with it.

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:25.310
Even though
all my stuff is very refined,

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:29.660
it doesn't mean I only care about money.

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:32.540
No, I didn't mean anything else.

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:36.580
I just think money
has nothing to do with love.

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:38.580
Yes, you're right.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:39.420
But...

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:42.470
Judging by how often
he's been disappearing lately,

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:44.430
you two haven't even met
that many times.

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:47.020
And I think

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.990
you two can't be in love at first sight.

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:56.470
Is he using every coupon when paying?

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:57.310
Trying for discounts?

00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:58.817
Then, splitting the bill in the end?

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:00.060
You know him too well.

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:02.910
Of course, I taught him all that.

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:05.140
Then teach me too.

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:06.750
I've been broke lately.

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:14.580
Yeah, you really are.

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.580
Mixing the dense style
and natural style lashes.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:19.910
What is that?

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:22.060
Fake eyelashes, didn't you notice?

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:25.710
They're the same.

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:26.980
Gosh...

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.540
This side is longer,
and that side is shorter.

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:32.310
Why aren't yours as long as hers?

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:33.150
What?

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:34.500
Say that again.

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:35.750
Open your eyes and look closely.

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:36.590
See?

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:37.830
Same.

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:38.830
Got it.

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:40.700
I'll tell you,

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.580
if you want to save money,
you must carry

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:45.580
discount coupons with you.

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:47.060
I have some too.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.862
(Three-person group discount coupon)
Perfect, let's see what to eat.

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.140
You two are a perfect match.

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:52.980
I got it!

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.270
How about we go eat together?

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:57.060
Three people get 30% off.

00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:58.750
Well...

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:00.270
You go ahead.

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:01.700
I won't go.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:03.430
I already have plans with a friend.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.660
I'll go with you next time.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:07.100
Then we'll eat at this place.

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:07.990
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.830
Let's go.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:10.790
- I paid the bill. Bye.
- Bye.

00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:12.270
Let's go.

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:22.750
Jia, can you go for a walk
with me today?

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:26.860
Sure.

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.580
How about we go shopping together?

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:36.620
(Why did you suddenly ask me out today?)

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:39.470
(Had a dose of love envy,
feeling a bit lonely.)

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:40.940
(Who?)

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:44.100
(Wu and his girlfriend, Wang Xiaoxiao.)

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:45.180
(I'm telling you,)

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:48.060
(they're literally made for each other.)

00:39:55.306 --> 00:39:56.910
Hey, what do you think of this bag?

00:39:57.928 --> 00:39:59.580
Seems like it has a lot of compartments.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:01.580
Those compartments are for organization.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.728
This side can hold a laptop.

00:40:02.751 --> 00:40:03.870
Here you can put your wallet.

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:05.140
Here you can put your phone.

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.430
And here is your key pouch.

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:07.950
Everything has its place.

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:10.684
- Each item stays where it belongs.
- Each item stays where it belongs.

00:40:10.706 --> 00:40:12.660
But don't you think
putting things all together

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:15.060
and rummaging through them is fun?

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:17.390
And things aren't lonely
when they're together.

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:20.060
Everyone has their quirks.

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:23.350
Let's look at the clothes first.

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.750
I plan to get both of these.

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:34.310
They are pretty, sure.

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.540
But it's the same style.

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:38.620
Why buy different colors?

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:40.270
I do this all the time.

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:43.060
Once I find something I like,
I get a few colors.

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:44.284
Then I mix and match at home.

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:46.270
What about you? How do you usually shop?

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:49.540
I look at the brand,
the price, and the style.

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:51.140
I think I've got to try

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.573
and change to a different style.

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:54.660
Then get both of these.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:55.500
Okay.

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.180
When I was your age,

00:40:57.350 --> 00:40:59.270
I also liked trying all kinds of styles.

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:01.100
But you're still young.

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.173
I don't have the luxury of trial
and error anymore.

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:09.620
Jia, how about...

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:11.620
You pick an outfit for me?

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:13.660
Would you like what I pick?

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:14.790
Not sure.

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:16.700
I think a new look

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.173
is the way to embrace a new life.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.100
Jia,

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.580
your taste is amazing.

00:41:27.462 --> 00:41:28.670
What are you looking at?

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:33.870
Isn't that...

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:38.310
Why try on every hat?

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:14.100
(Look, what kind of hat did Mr. Yu buy?)

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:18.470
(Do you think
he'll actually wear this out?)

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:21.310
(Not just out.)

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:38.790
(Look.)

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:40.540
Mr. Yu.

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:41.590
Speak.

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:45.390
You actually wore that thing
to work this morning?

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:47.060
This is called a hat.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:48.500
Yes, a hat.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.119
=Why Is He Still Single=
