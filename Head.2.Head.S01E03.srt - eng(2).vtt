00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:15.142
You boys are going to live together.

00:00:15.142 --> 00:00:19.946
And most importantly, you will help
each other with everything in daily life.

00:00:19.946 --> 00:00:20.732
I’m helping.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.922
You don’t have to look at me with heart eyes.

00:00:24.953 --> 00:00:28.068
I know I’m totally cool right now.

00:00:29.184 --> 00:00:29.928
J!

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.450
What’s up with him?

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.436
Even when you’re single,
you’ve got your buddy driving you around.

00:00:35.436 --> 00:00:36.411
He’s my hubby.

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:38.562
Don’t play—some ghostly force
might push you two together.

00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:46.377
Jinn, help me here.

00:00:46.377 --> 00:00:47.430
Ask nicely.

00:00:49.943 --> 00:00:51.664
Say ‘please’.

00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:54.823
Can you please help Nong?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.778
Hey, jerk.

00:01:28.216 --> 00:01:28.942
J.

00:01:32.722 --> 00:01:34.225
Asshole, what the hell are you doing?!

00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:35.020
Ouch.

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:41.910
My hand, you dickhead.

00:01:43.156 --> 00:01:45.025
Don’t be such a baby. I didn’t push that hard.

00:01:49.578 --> 00:01:50.764
Does it really hurt?

00:01:54.351 --> 00:01:56.447
My hand hit the floor. You saw that.

00:01:56.962 --> 00:01:59.151
It’s a broken finger, not a scratch.

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:02.313
Can’t you be gentle with me?

00:02:07.446 --> 00:02:08.809
Well, you were just—

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:10.616
What? I was just what?

00:02:12.313 --> 00:02:13.524
You were messing with me!

00:02:13.524 --> 00:02:14.024
Ouch.

00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:16.091
Ow.

00:02:20.408 --> 00:02:21.981
With this hand,

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.512
I don’t think I can keep working.

00:02:24.512 --> 00:02:26.178
I know it’s just your bullshit.

00:02:27.553 --> 00:02:28.911
But I’ll help.

00:02:30.114 --> 00:02:33.592
Consider it payback for... making you hurt.

00:02:36.534 --> 00:02:38.731
When you’re this tame and obedient,

00:02:41.158 --> 00:02:42.346
you’re kinda cute.

00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:53.997
F*ck. You. Jerk.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.968
Damn it.

00:03:07.433 --> 00:03:08.698
Why won’t it screw in?!

00:03:21.913 --> 00:03:22.644
Jinn.

00:03:27.111 --> 00:03:28.629
What do you think…

00:03:30.626 --> 00:03:32.170
we’ll be doing 10 years from now?

00:05:32.436 --> 00:05:34.383
Mai, what the hell
are you doing in my faculty?

00:05:34.383 --> 00:05:38.084
Hey, junior. Make sure to follow my design.

00:05:38.084 --> 00:05:39.664
Yeah, please fix it.

00:05:40.179 --> 00:05:41.040
Mai!

00:05:41.255 --> 00:05:42.751
Be quiet, will you, asshole?

00:05:43.975 --> 00:05:44.679
Why are you here?

00:05:45.323 --> 00:05:46.316
To see something.

00:05:46.896 --> 00:05:47.528
See what?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.816
Just you wait.

00:05:50.746 --> 00:05:51.396
What?

00:05:54.811 --> 00:05:55.579
They came together.

00:05:56.653 --> 00:05:57.308
Always.

00:05:58.382 --> 00:06:00.390
I told you something’s up.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.772
What’s with the twitchy eyes, Mai?

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:05.168
I can help massage them with my foot.

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:07.678
Nothing. The light is just too bright.

00:06:08.108 --> 00:06:08.826
I’m all good.

00:06:09.341 --> 00:06:10.153
Good.

00:06:10.625 --> 00:06:11.739
What’s up, you two?

00:06:11.739 --> 00:06:12.497
You came together again.

00:06:12.733 --> 00:06:14.053
You even pulled a chair out for him.

00:06:15.277 --> 00:06:17.367
What exactly is this relationship?

00:06:17.904 --> 00:06:19.678
You’ll be seeing this for a whole month.

00:06:19.871 --> 00:06:21.318
Better get used to it.

00:06:21.404 --> 00:06:22.967
You think I’m happy about this?

00:06:23.482 --> 00:06:26.942
I tell myself every day
that he’ll get better tomorrow.

00:06:27.135 --> 00:06:28.778
It just never comes true.

00:06:28.778 --> 00:06:29.416
Nonsense!

00:06:30.941 --> 00:06:32.995
If it healed that fast,

00:06:32.995 --> 00:06:34.735
it wouldn’t be a broken bone.

00:06:34.735 --> 00:06:36.218
Ever heard of sarcasm?

00:06:36.648 --> 00:06:38.113
I’m not that dumb.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.955
Well, you’re usually dumb.

00:06:40.062 --> 00:06:42.838
I thought that was just
your regular dumb self talking.

00:06:44.148 --> 00:06:44.812
Hey!

00:06:46.122 --> 00:06:47.419
Quit fighting like kids.

00:06:47.526 --> 00:06:49.384
I honestly feel bad for your moms.

00:06:49.556 --> 00:06:52.099
Is it a good idea for them
to punish you two like this?

00:06:52.185 --> 00:06:54.039
Every investment has risks.

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:57.255
If their sons don’t end up
kissing each other...

00:06:57.598 --> 00:06:59.694
Someone’s definitely gonna die.

00:06:59.694 --> 00:07:00.479
Exactly.

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:02.857
- You’re the first, Mai.
- Oh, I’m dead?

00:07:13.498 --> 00:07:15.274
Jinn, open your eyes.

00:07:15.424 --> 00:07:16.074
Jinn.

00:07:17.362 --> 00:07:18.373
Jinn, wake up.

00:07:18.373 --> 00:07:19.748
- Don’t die.
- J.

00:07:19.963 --> 00:07:20.696
J.

00:07:22.586 --> 00:07:23.590
J!

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:24.955
What?

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.036
You’ve got terrible hearing.

00:07:29.754 --> 00:07:31.077
I’m going downstairs to grab some snacks.

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:32.359
Anyone want to join me?

00:07:33.347 --> 00:07:35.612
I’ve been sitting here for like five minutes.

00:07:35.612 --> 00:07:37.401
And now you want me to walk again?

00:07:37.487 --> 00:07:38.430
Meaning?

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:39.484
Of course, I’m coming. I’m hungry.

00:07:39.484 --> 00:07:40.407
- Nice.
- Let’s go.

00:07:40.407 --> 00:07:40.907
You want anything?

00:07:41.014 --> 00:07:42.307
Nah, I’m good. Go ahead.

00:07:42.307 --> 00:07:44.431
- Coming?
- No. You go.

00:07:44.431 --> 00:07:47.537
- Come on, hurry.
- Don’t take forever.

00:07:49.048 --> 00:07:49.830
Mai, come on.

00:07:59.762 --> 00:08:01.040
What is it, Farm?

00:08:02.457 --> 00:08:03.400
I should ask you.

00:08:03.787 --> 00:08:05.033
Is there anything you want to tell me?

00:08:11.272 --> 00:08:12.821
Have you…

00:08:13.723 --> 00:08:15.481
ever dreamed about
the same thing over and over?

00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:17.035
What?

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.538
Well,

00:08:20.526 --> 00:08:21.879
every time I dream…

00:08:22.867 --> 00:08:24.671
there’s always this one person in it,

00:08:24.929 --> 00:08:27.066
just in different situations.

00:08:27.689 --> 00:08:31.109
Is the one you’re dreaming of a real person?

00:08:31.195 --> 00:08:31.938
Yes.

00:08:33.721 --> 00:08:34.855
I don’t think that’s weird.

00:08:35.757 --> 00:08:38.615
When I watch a movie
or listen to music before bed,

00:08:38.615 --> 00:08:39.745
I end up dreaming about them too.

00:08:42.107 --> 00:08:42.819
Really?

00:08:43.915 --> 00:08:44.622
Yeah.

00:08:45.352 --> 00:08:47.370
If someone’s always around you,

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.831
it’s not weird to dream about them, right?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.256
What if I told you I…

00:08:59.373 --> 00:09:00.075
You what?

00:09:02.652 --> 00:09:04.377
Everything I see in my dreams…

00:09:05.043 --> 00:09:06.537
always comes true.

00:09:08.792 --> 00:09:10.102
Are you saying…

00:09:13.753 --> 00:09:15.397
you can see the future?

00:09:17.867 --> 00:09:18.421
Mhm.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:19.915
Damn.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.162
We’ll take some of these, please.

00:09:24.162 --> 00:09:25.476
Grab whatever you like.

00:09:26.163 --> 00:09:27.474
100 baht.

00:09:27.474 --> 00:09:28.827
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

00:09:29.858 --> 00:09:31.506
You eat this kind of stuff now?

00:09:31.678 --> 00:09:33.627
Ah, these are for Farm. He likes them.

00:09:34.357 --> 00:09:36.924
By the way, now that you’re staying
at Farm’s place, how’s it going?

00:09:36.924 --> 00:09:39.319
Is he still as prissy as usual?

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.547
Even worse.

00:09:41.719 --> 00:09:43.582
He’s so freaking clean.

00:09:43.861 --> 00:09:48.234
Even his dirty clothes
are folded in the laundry basket.

00:09:48.234 --> 00:09:49.014
- What?
- What?

00:09:49.486 --> 00:09:50.281
I’m serious.

00:09:51.205 --> 00:09:53.555
Our laundry baskets are next to each other.

00:09:53.555 --> 00:09:55.956
Mine looks like a pile of
rotten veggies from the market.

00:09:55.956 --> 00:09:56.750
Can you picture that?

00:09:57.222 --> 00:09:59.588
Shit, yeah. I can totally see it.

00:10:00.426 --> 00:10:02.095
So are you staying there long term?

00:10:02.224 --> 00:10:04.832
Will you move out
when you get a new partner?

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.105
I’m giving my heart a break.

00:10:08.298 --> 00:10:09.333
A break, huh?

00:10:09.677 --> 00:10:10.966
Sadhu!

00:10:11.396 --> 00:10:12.721
Hope you actually give it a rest this time.

00:10:14.181 --> 00:10:16.179
Hey, I don’t want the same plot, though.

00:10:16.179 --> 00:10:19.951
The flirty playboy and the cranky roommate.

00:10:19.951 --> 00:10:21.042
Like hell!

00:10:22.159 --> 00:10:22.879
I agree.

00:10:23.051 --> 00:10:24.713
Farm’s a very good person.

00:10:24.906 --> 00:10:26.152
I don’t care who you mess with.

00:10:26.152 --> 00:10:28.611
But please don’t mess with friends.

00:10:29.707 --> 00:10:31.778
I’m not that evil.

00:10:31.778 --> 00:10:32.670
- You are!
- You are!

00:10:35.333 --> 00:10:35.979
Fine.

00:10:36.366 --> 00:10:38.012
I promise I won’t hurt him.

00:10:40.267 --> 00:10:42.039
Your response sounded kinda ambiguous.

00:10:42.039 --> 00:10:43.082
It does.

00:10:43.082 --> 00:10:44.599
I won’t hurt him.

00:10:45.565 --> 00:10:46.825
Damn you.

00:10:46.954 --> 00:10:48.309
Were you a snake in your past life?

00:10:48.309 --> 00:10:49.912
You just slither right out of everything.

00:10:49.912 --> 00:10:51.676
Yeah, I’m anaconda.

00:10:51.826 --> 00:10:53.443
You’re terrible.

00:11:01.353 --> 00:11:03.085
Mai asked if we’re down for a party tonight.

00:11:03.515 --> 00:11:04.394
You go.

00:11:04.931 --> 00:11:05.745
If you get too drunk, call me.

00:11:05.745 --> 00:11:06.422
I’ll come pick you up.

00:11:06.658 --> 00:11:08.224
No.

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:09.841
Come with me.

00:11:11.538 --> 00:11:13.507
I don’t like parties. You know that.

00:11:13.722 --> 00:11:14.951
Not going.

00:11:15.725 --> 00:11:18.383
J and Jinn have to
go home like good little boys.

00:11:18.383 --> 00:11:21.549
If it’s just me and Mai, it’ll be so freaking dull.

00:11:22.988 --> 00:11:25.033
I’m not going.

00:11:30.102 --> 00:11:31.504
Just come with me, please.

00:11:32.936 --> 00:11:35.034
Yeah, come with me.

00:11:42.214 --> 00:11:44.359
EXAMINATION ROOM 3

00:11:46.547 --> 00:11:47.239
So?

00:11:47.346 --> 00:11:48.347
What did the doctor say?

00:11:48.347 --> 00:11:49.232
Will you be fully healed by tomorrow?

00:11:49.511 --> 00:11:50.764
Tomorrow, my ass.

00:11:51.043 --> 00:11:53.069
You kicked me yesterday.
That’s why it got inflamed.

00:11:53.821 --> 00:11:55.176
I’m getting more meds.

00:11:56.142 --> 00:11:58.269
You’re made of glass.

00:11:58.763 --> 00:11:59.909
So fragile.

00:12:01.498 --> 00:12:03.273
You don’t even feel guilty for what you did.

00:12:04.175 --> 00:12:05.410
We need more meds, right?

00:12:05.582 --> 00:12:06.627
Come on. Let’s go.

00:12:06.992 --> 00:12:07.755
Hurry up.

00:12:07.755 --> 00:12:09.565
Come on, J.

00:12:22.626 --> 00:12:23.676
Why’d you stop?

00:12:28.229 --> 00:12:32.964
Even when I’m sixty or seventy, you still
have to buy me strawberry ice cream.

00:12:36.314 --> 00:12:37.098
Why are you spacing out?

00:12:40.277 --> 00:12:42.823
Hey, I want some ice cream.

00:12:43.188 --> 00:12:43.702
Huh?

00:12:44.132 --> 00:12:46.655
Just do it. Go buy it for me.

00:12:47.342 --> 00:12:48.322
You can get it yourself.

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:49.711
It’s less than 10 steps away.

00:12:50.914 --> 00:12:52.458
I want strawberry ice cream.

00:12:56.066 --> 00:12:57.380
Freaking unbelievable.

00:13:09.604 --> 00:13:10.249
Here.

00:13:21.854 --> 00:13:23.055
Ew!

00:13:24.279 --> 00:13:25.219
It tastes so bad.

00:13:28.398 --> 00:13:30.527
Then toss it. Why did you give it to me?

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:32.820
I didn’t want to waste it.

00:13:33.164 --> 00:13:34.764
Thought maybe you’d eat it.

00:13:37.169 --> 00:13:40.839
I really hate it when you make that face.

00:13:40.839 --> 00:13:42.492
It looks like you’re up to some shit.

00:13:42.492 --> 00:13:43.915
Just eat.

00:13:44.774 --> 00:13:45.955
If you don’t like it, throw it away.

00:13:55.963 --> 00:13:56.907
It’s pretty good.

00:14:02.234 --> 00:14:03.055
Are you in a hurry?

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:04.204
Why?

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.352
I’m thinking of dropping by to see Mom.

00:14:06.975 --> 00:14:07.682
Sure.

00:14:13.459 --> 00:14:15.782
So you really like strawberry ice cream?

00:14:19.288 --> 00:14:20.266
Why did you stop?

00:14:20.932 --> 00:14:22.554
Your hand hurts, not your legs.

00:14:22.661 --> 00:14:23.646
Keep walking.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:24.598
Yeah.

00:14:28.421 --> 00:14:32.241
When we’re alone, he’s actually kinda lovely.

00:14:32.928 --> 00:14:35.748
Even though I change partners a lot,

00:14:36.994 --> 00:14:38.969
I was always sincere.

00:14:54.317 --> 00:14:56.338
Hi. Welcome.

00:14:58.311 --> 00:15:01.164
- Oops.
- I missed you, gorgeous.

00:15:01.633 --> 00:15:02.578
Gosh.

00:15:02.982 --> 00:15:04.784
You scared me.

00:15:05.463 --> 00:15:07.000
Hello, Auntie Jan.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.318
Oh, J, you’re here too.

00:15:09.887 --> 00:15:11.406
That’s unexpected.

00:15:12.296 --> 00:15:15.178
I’m not used to seeing
you two show up together.

00:15:16.602 --> 00:15:22.231
Well, someone tied us together
like a pair of deep-fried dough sticks.

00:15:22.878 --> 00:15:23.500
Ouch.

00:15:23.775 --> 00:15:26.738
You still haven’t said why you’re here.

00:15:27.094 --> 00:15:33.375
I took J to the hospital nearby
to get his wound cleaned,

00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:36.568
so I dropped by to see my gorgeous mom.

00:15:38.477 --> 00:15:39.126
Right.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:40.509
Stay for dinner, then.

00:15:40.784 --> 00:15:41.787
Perfect!

00:15:41.916 --> 00:15:46.598
Eating with J always kills my appetite.

00:15:49.008 --> 00:15:51.009
Should I tell Auntie Jen you said that?

00:15:51.381 --> 00:15:52.608
Ow, don’t pinch me.

00:15:52.608 --> 00:15:53.913
If she hears it,

00:15:54.188 --> 00:15:55.111
your punishment’s getting extended.

00:15:55.111 --> 00:15:56.949
Please don’t tell my mom, Auntie Jan.

00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:57.869
Me and this ass—

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:00.974
I mean, we don’t hate each other anymore.

00:16:01.249 --> 00:16:04.831
But everyone still prefers
their own pillow and their own bed.

00:16:04.831 --> 00:16:06.124
That’s true, Mom.

00:16:06.124 --> 00:16:08.675
Like Nui Sujira once said,

00:16:08.675 --> 00:16:12.052
“Salmons may live out in the ocean,

00:16:12.359 --> 00:16:15.896
but in the end, they always
swim upstream to lay eggs in freshwater.”

00:16:18.522 --> 00:16:19.438
Do you get what I mean?

00:16:25.116 --> 00:16:26.707
What the hell was that salmon talk?

00:16:28.438 --> 00:16:30.211
Why? Isn’t it sharp?

00:16:30.664 --> 00:16:32.624
If our punishment gets extended,

00:16:32.786 --> 00:16:34.318
that’s on you.

00:16:34.884 --> 00:16:35.949
How come?

00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:39.006
Next time, if you don’t know
what to say, just make a sad face.

00:16:39.006 --> 00:16:40.091
Let me handle the rest.

00:16:42.129 --> 00:16:42.629
Okay?

00:16:43.341 --> 00:16:43.841
Okay.

00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:51.957
I’ve visited
Auntie Jan’s boutique so many times,

00:16:52.183 --> 00:16:53.865
but I never knew this room existed.

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.672
It’s a shame he’s not so famous anymore.

00:17:02.176 --> 00:17:04.343
If he were, I could sell
this photo for a fortune.

00:17:04.586 --> 00:17:05.227
Jinn.

00:17:10.193 --> 00:17:15.017
Who’d believe I’m the son of
the country’s number one actor back then?

00:17:15.891 --> 00:17:17.691
I can’t even believe it myself.

00:17:17.691 --> 00:17:19.077
Does he ever visit you?

00:17:19.708 --> 00:17:21.006
He would’ve been exposed if he did.

00:17:21.685 --> 00:17:23.300
He forgot he even had Mom and me.

00:17:24.335 --> 00:17:27.856
But it’s fine. We’re happy, just the two of us.

00:17:28.471 --> 00:17:30.374
Auntie Jan’s amazing

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.804
for raising you on her own.

00:17:32.901 --> 00:17:33.608
Yeah,

00:17:33.802 --> 00:17:35.046
I know my mom is great.

00:17:36.599 --> 00:17:38.502
You might be a douche sometimes,

00:17:39.133 --> 00:17:40.592
but overall, not a bad human being.

00:17:41.676 --> 00:17:42.176
Wait.

00:17:42.338 --> 00:17:43.892
I’m helping Auntie Jan set the table.

00:17:48.952 --> 00:17:51.609
I can’t even be nice to you
for one second, can I, dickhead?

00:17:52.968 --> 00:17:54.184
Did I get carried away?

00:17:54.977 --> 00:17:55.742
Damn it.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.642
We’re not at home,

00:17:58.998 --> 00:18:00.910
so I didn’t get to show off my cooking skills.

00:18:01.363 --> 00:18:04.255
Your food delivery skills
are good enough, ma’am.

00:18:06.164 --> 00:18:07.573
J, eat up.

00:18:08.398 --> 00:18:10.832
So you’ll have the energy to fight my son.

00:18:11.026 --> 00:18:12.236
- Of course.
- Can I get some too?

00:18:12.236 --> 00:18:13.455
Yeah? Alright, here.

00:18:14.959 --> 00:18:15.652
He always starts—

00:18:16.315 --> 00:18:17.791
Jinn’s not that bad.

00:18:18.519 --> 00:18:22.198
When we’re alone, he’s actually kinda lovely.

00:18:23.087 --> 00:18:23.652
Huh?

00:18:24.833 --> 00:18:26.491
Did I hear that right?

00:18:26.863 --> 00:18:28.718
Did you just say Jinn is lovely?

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.196
I’m serious.

00:18:32.536 --> 00:18:34.130
When he’s asleep,

00:18:34.708 --> 00:18:35.969
he looks like a newborn kitten.

00:18:39.063 --> 00:18:39.974
Is that so?

00:18:45.231 --> 00:18:45.731
Jinn.

00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:47.169
Yes, Mom?

00:18:47.169 --> 00:18:48.028
What about J?

00:18:48.028 --> 00:18:49.072
You haven’t said anything about him.

00:18:50.609 --> 00:18:51.753
Well…

00:18:52.868 --> 00:18:53.698
He’s—

00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:54.943
Ouch!

00:18:57.596 --> 00:18:58.620
What was that?

00:19:00.007 --> 00:19:00.961
Was it a rat?

00:19:02.012 --> 00:19:02.758
So?

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:04.280
He’s…

00:19:05.315 --> 00:19:06.953
a very lovely person.

00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:14.045
That’s great.

00:19:16.099 --> 00:19:18.345
But seriously,
what ran past my feet just now?

00:19:18.474 --> 00:19:19.554
I don’t think there’s a rat here.

00:19:21.188 --> 00:19:22.738
Bye-bye. I love you.

00:19:22.738 --> 00:19:23.482
Bye.

00:19:23.628 --> 00:19:24.953
Bye-bye.

00:19:28.528 --> 00:19:31.359
Holy shit, I can’t believe
I actually called you lovely.

00:19:31.359 --> 00:19:32.426
Newborn kitten.

00:19:32.588 --> 00:19:34.282
- Gosh.
- Ugh.

00:19:36.513 --> 00:19:39.460
Our lives get weirder every day.

00:19:40.598 --> 00:19:43.351
What else will we be forced
to do until your hand heals?

00:19:45.001 --> 00:19:46.097
I just can’t.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.557
It’s ridiculous.

00:20:14.616 --> 00:20:16.330
Hello!

00:20:16.492 --> 00:20:17.626
Hello!

00:20:18.548 --> 00:20:19.533
What are you guys doing here?

00:20:21.798 --> 00:20:24.107
Since you didn’t come party with us...

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.805
we brought the party to you instead.

00:20:26.805 --> 00:20:28.877
- Yay!
- Yay!

00:20:29.708 --> 00:20:30.686
Set it up, Mai.

00:20:30.686 --> 00:20:31.682
You got it, sir.

00:20:32.119 --> 00:20:33.441
This looks mouthwatering.

00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:34.625
I just can’t wait.

00:20:34.625 --> 00:20:36.414
Check this out. Look.

00:20:36.414 --> 00:20:38.167
We won’t let you down.

00:20:38.345 --> 00:20:39.475
Are you out of your mind?

00:20:39.708 --> 00:20:40.911
We can’t finish all this.

00:20:41.461 --> 00:20:42.214
This?

00:20:42.618 --> 00:20:43.763
Piece of cake.

00:20:43.763 --> 00:20:46.204
Less talking, more drinking.

00:20:52.805 --> 00:20:53.559
Van.

00:20:53.867 --> 00:20:54.367
Hm?

00:20:54.367 --> 00:20:54.932
Sit up properly.

00:20:56.291 --> 00:20:59.053
This is proper sitting.

00:21:00.282 --> 00:21:02.014
You’re such an ass!

00:21:03.243 --> 00:21:04.632
I said sit up straight.

00:21:06.589 --> 00:21:08.682
I used to think you were a heavyweight

00:21:09.022 --> 00:21:10.996
since you hang out at bars every other day.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.416
Now I know you’re just there to fish.

00:21:14.708 --> 00:21:15.354
Sure!

00:21:15.807 --> 00:21:16.969
I’m an asshole!

00:21:16.969 --> 00:21:21.449
That’s why I never find
true love like everyone else.

00:21:21.449 --> 00:21:24.437
That’s because you’re everything
but true love to your partners.

00:21:27.413 --> 00:21:29.990
Mai, don’t be too hard on him.

00:21:34.099 --> 00:21:36.841
Even though I change partners a lot,

00:21:37.666 --> 00:21:39.391
I was always sincere.

00:21:40.442 --> 00:21:42.230
It wasn’t just about sleeping with them.

00:21:43.718 --> 00:21:47.157
They just weren’t the right ones yet.

00:21:47.497 --> 00:21:49.475
So I had to end it.

00:21:49.637 --> 00:21:51.448
And when are you gonna meet the right one?

00:21:51.949 --> 00:21:52.449
Hm?

00:22:20.346 --> 00:22:21.339
You’re drunk, Van.

00:22:22.229 --> 00:22:22.950
Go to bed.

00:22:25.522 --> 00:22:26.201
I’m not drunk.

00:22:28.951 --> 00:22:30.443
Cheers!

00:22:30.766 --> 00:22:32.940
- Enough.
- Hey, let me drink.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:35.038
You should learn to take care of yourself.

00:22:35.442 --> 00:22:38.130
Be more like me.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:41.350
You hit those bars too often.

00:22:42.159 --> 00:22:43.628
Start thinking about your future.

00:22:43.628 --> 00:22:46.765
You can’t keep wasting time being dissolute.

00:22:46.765 --> 00:22:47.433
Understood?

00:22:47.854 --> 00:22:48.552
Good.

00:22:52.857 --> 00:22:54.468
Shit, when did you guys leave?

00:23:00.324 --> 00:23:01.088
What were you thinking,

00:23:01.412 --> 00:23:03.190
making your crush your roommate?

00:23:58.496 --> 00:23:59.713
- Oh, shit!
- Jinn, watch out!

00:23:59.887 --> 00:24:00.387
Geez!

00:24:02.045 --> 00:24:03.046
Why did you shout?

00:24:06.227 --> 00:24:06.920
You all right?

00:24:22.843 --> 00:24:24.293
Your car was gonna crash.

00:24:26.259 --> 00:24:27.509
Yeah, in the game,

00:24:27.798 --> 00:24:29.203
Did you have to be so shocked?

00:24:29.974 --> 00:24:31.323
Don’t ask so many questions.

00:24:31.766 --> 00:24:32.596
I’m having a headache.

00:25:15.161 --> 00:25:16.736
Bad headache?

00:25:19.994 --> 00:25:20.622
Mm.

00:25:25.461 --> 00:25:27.155
Want to see a doctor? I can take you.

00:25:29.565 --> 00:25:30.221
No.

00:25:34.071 --> 00:25:35.909
Why don’t you get up and take some pills?

00:25:39.823 --> 00:25:40.608
Take some—

00:25:40.608 --> 00:25:41.319
Damn it!

00:25:41.724 --> 00:25:43.105
Just leave me alone!

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.408
It’s already late.

00:26:17.986 --> 00:26:19.338
You can crash here tonight.

00:26:19.338 --> 00:26:20.545
We’ll go to uni together tomorrow.

00:26:21.432 --> 00:26:24.430
You just take care of
everyone in the world, don’t you?

00:26:24.816 --> 00:26:27.511
If you weren’t my friend, I’d totally hit on you.

00:26:27.511 --> 00:26:30.447
Mai, you know I don’t like it
when people joke like that.

00:26:30.582 --> 00:26:31.289
Why?

00:26:31.964 --> 00:26:33.353
Got a secret crush on a friend or something?

00:26:33.353 --> 00:26:33.961
Mai!

00:26:36.159 --> 00:26:40.387
What were you thinking,
making your crush your roommate?

00:26:41.698 --> 00:26:42.531
You know?

00:26:43.977 --> 00:26:45.109
I’m your friend.

00:26:45.842 --> 00:26:47.358
You can’t hide it from me for long.

00:26:47.666 --> 00:26:48.568
And honestly,

00:26:48.992 --> 00:26:51.681
I think J and Jinn already know too.

00:26:53.281 --> 00:26:55.252
Where’s everyone?!

00:26:55.599 --> 00:26:57.243
Why are you up, Van?

00:26:57.533 --> 00:26:59.202
Let’s keep drinking!

00:26:59.588 --> 00:27:00.851
Look at yourself.

00:27:01.314 --> 00:27:01.814
Oh!

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.470
Yeah, it’s a cigarette.

00:27:04.048 --> 00:27:04.960
Can I get some?

00:27:05.268 --> 00:27:06.959
No, you can’t.

00:27:07.325 --> 00:27:08.680
Don’t do this, Van.

00:27:09.066 --> 00:27:10.238
- I can’t?
- Right.

00:27:13.149 --> 00:27:14.654
Then what can I get?

00:27:20.326 --> 00:27:20.861
You—

00:27:53.517 --> 00:27:54.388
He’s drunk.

00:27:55.217 --> 00:27:56.652
You don’t have to tell him anything.

00:28:02.031 --> 00:28:04.301
It’s my feeling. I can deal with it.

00:28:05.438 --> 00:28:06.746
Don’t bother him with it.

00:28:08.674 --> 00:28:11.396
Let’s just say I didn’t see anything.

00:29:05.517 --> 00:29:06.192
Jinn.

00:29:09.376 --> 00:29:10.736
I…

00:29:11.469 --> 00:29:12.084
I’m sorry.

00:29:13.877 --> 00:29:14.593
What?!

00:29:15.518 --> 00:29:17.219
For lashing out at you last night.

00:29:20.824 --> 00:29:22.567
I’m… sorry.

00:29:26.037 --> 00:29:27.963
Who are you? You’re possessing my friend.

00:29:27.963 --> 00:29:28.675
I know what to do.

00:29:31.567 --> 00:29:32.749
Get out! Shoo!

00:29:34.021 --> 00:29:34.860
It’s a ghost.

00:29:35.458 --> 00:29:36.617
Who the hell shooes a ghost like it’s a dog?

00:29:38.217 --> 00:29:40.215
You just admitted it? What are you?

00:29:40.215 --> 00:29:41.345
A Dracula? A crazy dog spirit?

00:29:41.345 --> 00:29:43.213
A filth-eating spirit? An ogre? Frankenstein?

00:29:43.213 --> 00:29:43.831
Cut it out!

00:29:44.603 --> 00:29:45.320
You idiot.

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:50.200
J, you dickhead.

00:29:51.777 --> 00:29:53.464
Ugh, my shoe’s stuck.

00:29:55.141 --> 00:29:55.841
- Boo!
- Jeez!

00:29:57.846 --> 00:29:59.018
Damn you, J.
You wanna fight?

00:30:15.331 --> 00:30:16.424
You okay there, Van?

00:30:16.424 --> 00:30:17.201
I’m all good.

00:30:17.201 --> 00:30:18.512
You don’t look so good.

00:30:26.551 --> 00:30:29.425
I didn’t know you slept in my room last night.

00:30:29.807 --> 00:30:33.676
Don’t tell me you don’t remember
anything from last—

00:30:33.676 --> 00:30:34.526
Ahem!

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.102
I remember vaguely.

00:30:38.102 --> 00:30:40.043
No need to remind him about last night.

00:30:40.621 --> 00:30:42.400
He gets weird when he’s drunk.

00:30:42.554 --> 00:30:44.187
People always say I’m cute when I’m drunk.

00:30:44.187 --> 00:30:46.096
You’re the only one who says I’m weird.

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.039
Am I really not cute?

00:30:52.716 --> 00:30:54.072
Just buckle up.

00:30:55.383 --> 00:30:56.842
Cold as ever.

00:30:57.285 --> 00:30:58.860
- Van.
- Yes?

00:30:58.956 --> 00:31:00.348
Behave.

00:31:04.902 --> 00:31:05.874
You’re staring.

00:31:06.761 --> 00:31:08.037
Do you want a problem, dear?

00:31:08.519 --> 00:31:12.175
How many times
do I have to say I don’t like this?

00:31:12.773 --> 00:31:13.441
I’m sorry.

00:31:13.441 --> 00:31:15.471
Why do you have to be so serious?

00:31:15.471 --> 00:31:17.103
Friends don’t do this.

00:31:17.778 --> 00:31:20.060
Hey, nice weather today.

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:20.818
I feel like walking to uni.

00:31:20.818 --> 00:31:21.726
Don’t be so grumpy.

00:31:21.803 --> 00:31:23.142
I’m just playing.

00:31:23.605 --> 00:31:25.991
If you don’t feel anything,
no need to get all worked up.

00:31:26.087 --> 00:31:27.542
What if someone does feel it?

00:31:27.542 --> 00:31:30.555
Someone, please get me out of here.

00:31:31.018 --> 00:31:31.885
What are you saying?

00:31:32.694 --> 00:31:35.242
You’re the player. You’re having fun.

00:31:35.666 --> 00:31:37.537
But if you’re the one getting played,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.170
it won’t be fun anymore.

00:31:41.252 --> 00:31:42.289
I’m sorry, Farm.

00:31:42.289 --> 00:31:43.944
Don’t be so mad.

00:31:44.175 --> 00:31:45.254
I read too much into it.

00:31:45.254 --> 00:31:46.932
Sorry, I took it out on you.

00:31:47.395 --> 00:31:49.667
Put on your seltbelt. We’re taking off.

00:31:49.667 --> 00:31:51.097
Yeah, I’m taking off too. I’m outta here.

00:31:51.097 --> 00:31:52.141
Stay, Mai.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.405
You didn’t even invite us to your party.

00:32:11.037 --> 00:32:13.056
As if you’d have time for us.

00:32:13.326 --> 00:32:16.472
All you do now is
babysit your new best friend.

00:32:19.402 --> 00:32:20.455
It’s mandatory.

00:32:20.609 --> 00:32:22.376
How many times
do I have to tell you he’s limping?

00:32:23.533 --> 00:32:25.634
Right, “mandatory.”

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:28.679
So, when are you two
going back to the circuit?

00:32:28.968 --> 00:32:30.224
Tar misses you.

00:32:30.629 --> 00:32:32.429
He still misses them?

00:32:32.622 --> 00:32:36.506
If I were him, I’d blacklist them both.

00:32:36.506 --> 00:32:38.683
They’d be totally banned
after almost wrecking the track.

00:32:38.683 --> 00:32:39.670
That had nothing to do with me.

00:32:39.998 --> 00:32:41.040
I didn’t do anything.

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.604
He’s the one responsible.

00:32:42.604 --> 00:32:43.947
But you guys were racing.

00:32:44.159 --> 00:32:45.014
But he was the one who crashed.

00:32:45.014 --> 00:32:45.592
Hey.

00:32:46.845 --> 00:32:48.880
Did you figure out what’s happening to you?

00:32:52.331 --> 00:32:52.869
No.

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:55.057
But I didn’t dream about anything last night.

00:32:55.231 --> 00:32:58.188
Maybe it’s a side effect of the crash.

00:32:58.188 --> 00:32:59.032
What do you think?

00:33:02.367 --> 00:33:03.937
I hope so.

00:33:04.747 --> 00:33:08.032
I think you should consult a doctor.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:10.373
How am I supposed to explain it to a doctor?

00:33:11.472 --> 00:33:13.969
I can’t even wrap my head
around it when I talk to you.

00:33:14.277 --> 00:33:15.524
Then keep observing yourself.

00:33:16.044 --> 00:33:17.536
Whatever it is, you can talk to me.

00:33:17.652 --> 00:33:18.526
Or Jinn.

00:33:19.027 --> 00:33:19.690
Yeah.

00:33:21.714 --> 00:33:22.688
I’m sleepy.

00:33:23.421 --> 00:33:24.123
I’m gonna take a nap.

00:33:24.123 --> 00:33:24.623
Hey.

00:33:25.317 --> 00:33:25.991
What about the assignment?

00:33:26.434 --> 00:33:28.522
Do it for me, please.

00:33:40.245 --> 00:33:41.892
You know, I’ve been writing this

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.150
since high school, and in college too.

00:33:45.555 --> 00:33:46.692
It’s not something I just started.

00:33:47.926 --> 00:33:51.842
You didn’t seem like the type
who’d do anything like this back then.

00:33:52.613 --> 00:33:53.564
No surprise there.

00:33:54.007 --> 00:33:55.745
You didn’t know me that well.

00:33:57.249 --> 00:33:59.514
I don’t even know if “write” is the right word.

00:33:59.957 --> 00:34:00.856
Let’s just say I “complain” in here.

00:34:03.381 --> 00:34:05.024
I jot down whatever’s bothering me.

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:07.052
Hm…

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:13.468
There’s something about you in here too.

00:34:17.208 --> 00:34:17.953
Are you okay, J?

00:34:22.045 --> 00:34:23.071
Is it happening again?

00:34:26.445 --> 00:34:27.152
Are you alright?

00:34:27.769 --> 00:34:28.693
I am.

00:34:29.079 --> 00:34:30.048
I’m gonna skip today.

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:42.233
Farm.

00:34:44.546 --> 00:34:47.224
What did you mean by
“Is it happening again?”

00:34:52.738 --> 00:34:55.310
I was sleepy, so I went to nap somewhere.

00:34:55.464 --> 00:34:57.244
Should I call Auntie Jen and ask her
to book you a doctor’s appointment?

00:34:57.244 --> 00:34:58.353
Are you worried about me?

00:35:42.229 --> 00:35:43.744
There’s something about you in here too.

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.032
There’s something about you in here too.

00:35:58.285 --> 00:36:00.143
Long time no see, J.

00:36:02.344 --> 00:36:02.867
Beam.

00:36:10.999 --> 00:36:12.064
What did he tell you?

00:36:14.186 --> 00:36:14.970
Nothing.

00:36:15.525 --> 00:36:18.649
He just said he couldn’t sleep
and had weird dreams.

00:36:18.649 --> 00:36:19.737
That’s all.

00:36:21.919 --> 00:36:23.712
Why are you suddenly suspicious of J?

00:36:24.346 --> 00:36:25.606
Did he do something weird to you?

00:36:25.904 --> 00:36:26.578
Hell yeah.

00:36:26.796 --> 00:36:27.926
He’s been acting strange.

00:36:28.323 --> 00:36:29.659
Sometimes he just zones out,

00:36:29.659 --> 00:36:30.833
like he’s deep in thought.

00:36:31.527 --> 00:36:33.284
Sometimes he just freezes.

00:36:35.364 --> 00:36:36.623
Gosh, I can’t even explain it.

00:36:36.623 --> 00:36:37.623
You’ve gotta see it yourself.

00:36:37.782 --> 00:36:39.674
Maybe he’s always been like that.

00:36:39.674 --> 00:36:41.665
You just didn’t care enough to notice before.

00:36:42.716 --> 00:36:43.269
You think?

00:36:43.269 --> 00:36:44.491
Nah, I’m just talking nonsense.

00:36:45.304 --> 00:36:47.738
Mai, you dick!

00:36:47.738 --> 00:36:48.968
That’s Mai junior down there.

00:36:51.447 --> 00:36:52.954
It’s not just J who’s weird.

00:36:53.767 --> 00:36:54.990
You’re weird too, Jinn.

00:36:55.644 --> 00:36:57.166
- Me?
- Mm.

00:36:58.396 --> 00:36:59.323
Weird how?

00:36:59.482 --> 00:37:00.916
You two were always fighting before.

00:37:01.233 --> 00:37:02.378
Look at you now.

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:05.028
What about me now?

00:37:06.952 --> 00:37:09.445
You seem to care a lot about him.

00:37:15.831 --> 00:37:17.760
- Aw!
- Aw!

00:37:19.009 --> 00:37:20.114
I don’t care, okay?

00:37:20.114 --> 00:37:21.849
I’m just scared he’ll die in my room.

00:37:23.158 --> 00:37:25.376
I just bought that condo, you know?

00:37:25.475 --> 00:37:27.407
I don’t want his ghost haunting the place.

00:37:27.407 --> 00:37:29.663
Ah! So that’s the reason.

00:37:29.663 --> 00:37:30.947
I guess it makes sense.

00:37:46.892 --> 00:37:47.788
Have you been well?

00:37:49.018 --> 00:37:49.631
Yeah.

00:37:51.733 --> 00:37:53.307
We haven’t seen each other in a while.

00:37:56.222 --> 00:37:57.159
How’s your injury?

00:37:59.579 --> 00:38:02.681
It’s broken, so it’s gonna take time to heal.

00:38:05.364 --> 00:38:10.318
I heard you’re staying at Jinn’s place now.

00:38:11.706 --> 00:38:12.559
You knew?

00:38:14.384 --> 00:38:15.965
It’s hard to believe.

00:38:16.401 --> 00:38:20.206
Two people who hate
each other’s guts are living together.

00:38:20.325 --> 00:38:22.133
Well, it’s…

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:23.544
It’s a long story.

00:38:23.901 --> 00:38:25.458
I’m sure it is.

00:38:26.073 --> 00:38:27.816
That must be why you
haven’t reached out since that day.

00:38:30.474 --> 00:38:31.927
Are you dumping me, J?

00:38:35.021 --> 00:38:39.284
I heard you and Jinn are always competing.

00:38:40.355 --> 00:38:42.314
It sounded fun at first.

00:38:43.663 --> 00:38:46.463
But I didn’t think I’d be the prize.

00:38:47.364 --> 00:38:48.612
Once you guys got me, I was tossed aside.

00:38:49.207 --> 00:38:50.128
It’s all me.

00:38:50.445 --> 00:38:51.316
Jinn had nothing to do with that.

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.588
Wow.

00:38:54.687 --> 00:38:58.091
So not only are you done fighting,
now you’re defending each other too.

00:39:01.482 --> 00:39:02.288
I’m sorry.

00:39:03.339 --> 00:39:04.040
Good.

00:39:04.417 --> 00:39:05.778
I appreciate the honesty.

00:39:05.956 --> 00:39:07.332
Makes it easier for me to move on.

00:39:20.203 --> 00:39:21.069
What’s this veggie called again?

00:39:21.069 --> 00:39:22.491
Is it… malindjo something?

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:23.717
This is stir-fried malindjo leaves with eggs.

00:39:23.717 --> 00:39:25.052
Right, stir-fried malindjo leaves with eggs.

00:39:25.052 --> 00:39:25.552
Hey.

00:39:26.365 --> 00:39:27.630
Where have you been?

00:39:27.967 --> 00:39:29.208
I thought you were dead.

00:39:30.894 --> 00:39:33.515
I was sleepy, so I went to nap somewhere.

00:39:34.229 --> 00:39:36.227
Why do you nap so damn much?

00:39:36.346 --> 00:39:38.378
It’s like that’s all you do.

00:39:38.378 --> 00:39:39.760
Maybe you should get checked out.

00:39:39.879 --> 00:39:41.299
You’re getting your
wound cleaned today, right?

00:39:42.588 --> 00:39:45.216
Take him to the doctor
and ask what’s wrong with him.

00:39:46.703 --> 00:39:47.825
Nothing’s wrong.

00:39:48.757 --> 00:39:51.142
I just haven’t slept well.
It’s not my own place, that’s all.

00:39:53.086 --> 00:39:55.769
You can use that excuse with the ladies.

00:39:56.027 --> 00:39:57.140
Should we tell them?

00:39:57.794 --> 00:40:01.176
Maybe they’ll go soft and let you go home.

00:40:01.513 --> 00:40:03.616
Trying your luck, huh?

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:06.873
I’ll adjust soon enough.

00:40:09.174 --> 00:40:10.785
Gosh. How boring.

00:40:11.261 --> 00:40:12.377
Are you done eating?

00:40:12.516 --> 00:40:13.867
If you are, we can head to the hospital.

00:40:16.644 --> 00:40:18.306
Don’t just eat the rice.

00:40:18.306 --> 00:40:18.981
Take it easy.

00:40:19.199 --> 00:40:20.592
Return this plate for me.

00:40:22.318 --> 00:40:23.096
- Later.
- Later.

00:40:25.357 --> 00:40:26.097
Come on.

00:40:28.616 --> 00:40:31.283
I never thought I’d see that.

00:40:31.699 --> 00:40:33.813
Normally, they’d start
a fistfight just by looking at each other.

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:35.688
Now they’re glued together,

00:40:35.906 --> 00:40:37.327
driving each other around,

00:40:37.327 --> 00:40:38.380
and even sleeping under the same roof.

00:40:38.896 --> 00:40:39.974
If they end up together,

00:40:40.053 --> 00:40:41.457
the world might just burn.

00:40:41.715 --> 00:40:42.492
It’s no good.

00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:45.028
Being friends is perfect as it is.

00:40:46.059 --> 00:40:49.681
But friends can turn into lovers.

00:40:50.534 --> 00:40:51.170
Right?

00:40:54.502 --> 00:40:57.115
Yeah, but it shouldn’t apply to close friends.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.261
Friends are friends.

00:41:00.657 --> 00:41:02.024
Don’t over-categorize.

00:41:02.341 --> 00:41:03.618
You should categorize sometimes.

00:41:04.531 --> 00:41:05.925
I’ll just eat.

00:41:13.991 --> 00:41:14.658
J.

00:41:16.264 --> 00:41:18.007
Should I call Auntie Jen and ask her
to book you a doctor’s appointment?

00:41:21.954 --> 00:41:23.136
I’m really fine.

00:41:25.635 --> 00:41:26.293
Are you sure?

00:41:31.229 --> 00:41:31.910
What?

00:41:32.723 --> 00:41:33.744
Are you worried about me?

00:41:39.818 --> 00:41:41.311
I’d rather worry about a dog than you.

00:42:05.015 --> 00:42:06.349
There’s something about you in here too.

00:42:07.202 --> 00:42:07.892
Really?

00:42:09.419 --> 00:42:12.921
How come I’ve never
seen this notebook before?

00:42:13.536 --> 00:42:14.702
How would you?

00:42:14.861 --> 00:42:17.943
I hid it in my underwear drawer.

00:42:27.529 --> 00:42:28.661
I want to go to your place.

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:32.636
But you need to get your wound cleaned.

00:42:32.834 --> 00:42:34.168
We’re almost at the hospital.

00:42:35.596 --> 00:42:36.581
Turn the car around, Jinn.

00:42:37.791 --> 00:42:39.830
J, are you out of your mind?

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:40.740
I want to go back to the condo.

00:42:41.256 --> 00:42:42.100
Now.

00:42:45.412 --> 00:42:46.998
Fine. Alright.

00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:49.227
If your wound gets infected, don’t blame me.

00:43:14.283 --> 00:43:14.789
Hey.

00:43:16.574 --> 00:43:17.948
What is the matter with this dude?

00:43:40.505 --> 00:43:42.845
J, why did you lock the door?

00:43:43.222 --> 00:43:44.129
It’s my room.

00:43:47.364 --> 00:43:48.148
Hey, jerk-face.

00:43:52.154 --> 00:43:53.468
Open up.

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:57.386
J.

00:44:06.211 --> 00:44:07.167
J!

00:44:07.856 --> 00:44:10.246
It’s my room. I said open up.

00:44:20.379 --> 00:44:22.207
Fine. You wanna do this?

00:44:24.131 --> 00:44:25.364
I’ve got the key.

00:44:40.895 --> 00:44:42.470
(Being this close to you...

00:44:42.847 --> 00:44:45.474
how am I supposed to stop myself
from feeling something for you?)

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:57.617
You prick. Why are you touching my stuff?!

00:44:57.994 --> 00:44:58.494
Jinn.

00:44:58.494 --> 00:44:59.176
What the hell’s wrong with you?

00:44:59.176 --> 00:45:00.036
It’s my personal stuff!

00:45:00.849 --> 00:45:01.467
Jinn.

00:45:01.467 --> 00:45:02.659
Just go home.

00:45:04.186 --> 00:45:05.544
Stay the hell away from me. Leave!

00:45:05.544 --> 00:45:06.044
Jinn.

00:45:06.361 --> 00:45:07.054
Damn it!

00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:08.691
- Jinn!
- What?!

00:45:08.691 --> 00:45:09.669
- Hear me out first.
- Let go of me!

00:45:10.165 --> 00:45:10.925
No.

00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:18.450
Just listen to me.

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:19.088
Hands off me!

00:45:19.088 --> 00:45:20.389
Hear me out!

00:45:24.657 --> 00:45:25.825
Do you still like me?

00:45:47.995 --> 00:45:49.097
Does it bother you,

00:45:49.811 --> 00:45:52.299
knowing I still have feelings for you?

00:45:55.115 --> 00:45:58.628
You must be wondering
why I’m hugging you.

00:45:59.977 --> 00:46:01.725
Can you not ask questions right now?

00:46:04.145 --> 00:46:05.967
Everyone wants true love, don’t they?

00:46:06.225 --> 00:46:08.815
But before you can have it,

00:46:08.815 --> 00:46:11.354
you need to learn to be that for someone.

00:46:15.221 --> 00:46:16.913
What even counts as true love?

00:46:18.658 --> 00:46:20.119
Can I even be that for you?

00:46:22.717 --> 00:46:24.678
When did we start hating on each other?

00:46:24.817 --> 00:46:26.069
I really can’t recall.

00:46:28.469 --> 00:46:29.565
I’m in the lead.

00:46:29.565 --> 00:46:30.210
Hey!

00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:31.258
I never hated you.
