00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.720
Why are you moving around?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.840
Lie down right now.

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:48.919
You scared me to death.

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:50.520
I thought something happened to you.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.200
The doctor said your injury is serious.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.159
You need to rest for a few days.

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:12.639
What's wrong?

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:15.599
It's just an errand.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.199
You're a bit too loyal, aren't you?

00:01:20.199 --> 00:01:21.879
Aren't you supposed to help the Empress Dowager

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:23.639
by taking the Seven Stars Lamp from me?

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.599
No need to risk your life for it.

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:49.360
Man'er,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.760
Mom brought medicine for you.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.639
Mom!

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:57.120
I missed you so much.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.919
Look.

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:00.919
Xiao Man,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.239
You must be starving.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.599
Let me make you

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.040
some steamed buns with chopped filling.

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.839
Okay!

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.839
Li Xiu Lan!

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.679
Where have you been these days?

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.000
Hurry, hurry!

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:46.240
Bring it over!

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:48.240
I'm starving.

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:55.520
Xiao Man,

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:56.639
Take your medicine first.

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:08.919
Isn't it hot?

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.279
You little rascal!

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.440
No one's fighting you for food.

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:37.000
Put it down!

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:43.559
I said put it down!

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.440
I said put it down!

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.320
Wife,

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:14.759
Our son's neck

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.480
was sucked dry by bugs.

00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:32.160
Xiao Man...

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.760
Xiao...

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.000
Man...

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:09.559
In the dream,

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.519
Xiu Lan's son was sick.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.359
Xiu Lan was holding a packet of medicine.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.839
So,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.559
her obsession must be related to

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:17.920
her son Xiao Man.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.799
That's progress.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.239
But...

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.320
Where's Xiu Lan's body?

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.320
It rained heavily last night.

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:29.359
The traces were washed away.

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:31.279
But there's blood there.

00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:32.959
It matches the dream.

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:35.320
Let's ask the yamen first.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.119
Something's odd here.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.959
No one reported it.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.160
No one found the body.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.000
Could it be...

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.440
But Xiu Lan clearly died here.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.760
Could it be...

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.480
the body ran off by itself?

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:53.399
Maybe someone

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:55.320
didn't want the body found.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.799
Respectfully welcome Inspector Jin An.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.959
What did Prince ask you just now?

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.679
Repeat every word exactly.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.279
Not feeling well again.

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:16.079
Take your medicine quickly.

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:19.760
My master isn't here.

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:21.119
I have to ration the medicine.

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:22.600
The most urgent thing now

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.040
is to fulfill Xiu Lan's obsession.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.959
That's more important than anything.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.720
Her obsession

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.000
must be about her son Xiao Man.

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:43.679
Who gave this to you?

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:46.160
Be careful.

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:47.239
This medicine packet

00:06:47.239 --> 00:06:48.799
was bought specially at Bao Zhi Tang.

00:06:48.799 --> 00:06:49.799
It's for balancing yin and yang.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.559
Is this mark unique to them?

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:53.720
Of course.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.679
Bao Zhi Tang's medicine is expensive.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.880
Only the rich here can afford it.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.160
Look,

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.440
this mark proves it's authentic.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.959
Otherwise, those street sorcerers

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:06.239
would fake it.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.640
Think carefully again.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.279
Yes.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.359
It's a formula to repel bugs.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.720
There is one like that.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.720
But you said there wasn't.

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:22.320
But...

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.839
The person who picked it up wasn't a woman.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.079
It was a strong man.

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:27.079
He works at the dyehouse, I think.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.000
His surname is Dong.

00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:29.320
Dyehouse...

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.440
Don't you see we're busy now?

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.399
Everyone's quitting these days.

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:34.279
What about Xiu Lan?

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:35.839
She didn't come today either, right?

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:37.880
Just like her husband.

00:07:38.799 --> 00:07:40.279
Do you have a worker

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:41.000
named Xiu Lan?

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:42.279
What's it to you?

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.000
Don't you know the rules?

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:46.239
Yes.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.119
She works here as a dyer.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.279
Does she have a son named Xiao Man?

00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:51.600
Where does she live?

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.359
Where did she go last night?

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.880
Who are you people?

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.440
You can't even recognize this?

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.239
God of Wealth.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.519
Those who work here

00:08:09.519 --> 00:08:11.359
are all from nearby villages.

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:12.720
I never ask.

00:08:13.079 --> 00:08:15.079
There's no work at night in the dyehouse.

00:08:15.359 --> 00:08:16.640
Where Xiu Lan goes

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.000
I have no idea.

00:08:18.239 --> 00:08:19.959
That's as good as saying nothing.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.920
Do you have a worker named Dong?

00:08:24.079 --> 00:08:25.000
You mean...

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.359
Dong Dachang?

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.200
I'm looking for him too.

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:31.920
He's worked here for years.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.719
He settled his wages yesterday.

00:08:33.719 --> 00:08:35.080
Now he's disappeared.

00:08:35.479 --> 00:08:37.400
Does he have any usual hangouts?

00:08:38.119 --> 00:08:39.159
Him?

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.679
He only knows how to work and earn money.

00:08:46.679 --> 00:08:47.320
Wait, that's not right.

00:08:47.719 --> 00:08:50.479
He's been acting strange lately.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.719
I've seen him at the gambling house a few times.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.640
Gambling house...

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.280
This guy...

00:08:55.599 --> 00:08:58.640
Maybe his old habit is back.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.679
What are you guys doing here?

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:19.039
If you're not gambling, get out.

00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:24.080
You're like a money-giving kid.

00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:29.000
The Dong Dachang you two mentioned—

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.960
I remember now.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.320
That big, dumb guy.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.359
He doesn't gamble either.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.000
He comes every day just to find Zhang Shuisheng.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.320
Zhang Shuisheng.

00:09:38.359 --> 00:09:40.039
What's your relationship with Zhang Shuisheng?

00:09:40.039 --> 00:09:41.000
Does he owe you money?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.799
Aren't you tired of watching him all day?

00:09:44.719 --> 00:09:45.520
We're just friends.

00:09:46.239 --> 00:09:47.039
Sorry to trouble you.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.200
Please don't let him come again.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.080
Brother,

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.280
That's not up to me.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.679
He goes where he wants.

00:09:52.119 --> 00:09:53.280
Can you help us out?

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.039
He has a seriously ill son.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.599
Does Zhang Shuisheng have a wife?

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.840
I think her name is—

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.679
Xiu Lan.

00:10:04.719 --> 00:10:06.440
Sir, you guessed right.

00:10:06.559 --> 00:10:07.520
Why not play a couple rounds?

00:10:07.679 --> 00:10:09.000
It'd be a shame not to play.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.880
That bastard Zhang Shuisheng—

00:10:11.479 --> 00:10:12.640
His son is so sick,

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.640
yet he still comes to the gambling house.

00:10:14.559 --> 00:10:16.320
That kid isn't his biological son.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.760
Xiu Lan remarried into his family.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.719
Now you get it, right?

00:10:19.479 --> 00:10:20.960
You dared to lend him money back then,

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.520
so you must know where he lives.

00:10:22.799 --> 00:10:23.760
Of course.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.880
Finally, we know Xiu Lan's address.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.479
Prince,

00:10:29.479 --> 00:10:31.359
The body you mentioned has been found.

00:10:33.719 --> 00:10:35.000
Is it Xiu Lan?

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:35.799
Yes.

00:10:36.039 --> 00:10:37.280
A man named Dong Dachang.

00:10:46.719 --> 00:10:47.400
Dad,

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.239
I'm so hungry.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:50.960
Eat quickly.

00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:53.359
The food on the table

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.799
was all brought home for you by Dad.

00:10:56.479 --> 00:10:57.880
I can't eat.

00:10:58.239 --> 00:10:59.640
Where's Mom?

00:11:00.599 --> 00:11:01.719
In a bit,

00:11:02.239 --> 00:11:04.000
I'll take you to see your mom.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.559
The grave in the painting was dug up.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.400
What grave?

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.840
The grave mound in the painting is open.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.679
What's drawn in this painting

00:11:21.599 --> 00:11:23.479
is all our own home.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.840
The backyard.

00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:29.280
How could a grave be open?

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.239
Dad,

00:11:48.719 --> 00:11:52.080
there's a woman standing inside.
