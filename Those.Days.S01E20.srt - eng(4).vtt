=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.980
=Episode 20=

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.500
It is all put together.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.860
Mom, do you know that master?

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.860
Can he fix it?

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.220
I just...

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.540
I am not sure.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.260
I will take it tomorrow and ask him.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.820
That programme
on the TV station, that one...

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.980
Does it not feature gold inlaid jade?

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.180
We could add a bit of gold to secure it.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.220
It might even look better.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.580
Dad.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.700
This is Mingzhu's
in-laws' ancestral treasure.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.500
If you add gold to it
and let Mingzhu take it back,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.700
her in-laws will not be happy.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.740
It must look exactly the same.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.300
Only then can Mingzhu explain herself.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.020
Exactly the same.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.020
I think that will be quite difficult.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.540
For Mingzhu, we must do it
no matter how hard it is.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.180
Do it.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.180
This.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.300
Master Jin.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.180
Please have a look.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.740
Can it be repaired?

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.860
Let me take a look first.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.140
It needs to fit perfectly.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.980
I must see it before I say anything.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.940
All right.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.700
Mom.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.740
Mom.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.420
I am here.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.620
All right.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.860
I am coming.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.300
Is it done?

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.940
I mean, is it repaired?

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.500
It is repaired.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.620
I went over early this morning.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.940
I was worried that her mother-in-law

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.300
would see your sister's wrist empty

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.500
and become suspicious.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.540
Slow down. Do not grab it.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.940
Slow down.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.420
You really are a mother-in-law.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.260
Very experienced.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.820
The master repaired it beautifully.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.780
Of course. He is an old master.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.780
After it was repaired,

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.980
I checked it under the light
to looked for the crack.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.420
I could not find it at all.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:23.300
You know,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.060
you really cannot see anything.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.620
It is repaired so perfectly, Mom.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.660
Yes, slow down.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.060
I need to take this to Mingzhu at once.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.220
Let me wrap it for you.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.220
Slow down, take your time.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.900
I am not going to break it.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.700
Just be a little careful.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.340
Keep it safe.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.750
- Come, let me help.
- It is safe.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.940
Do not rush.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.050
- It is safe.
- I am heading out.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.860
Wait.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.820
What is it?

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.340
Are you asking me for the repair fee?

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.220
Mingzhu is your own daughter,

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.340
spending a little is nothing.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.700
That is not it.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.580
What?

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.980
(IOU. I, Xu Zhidong, owe Xu Zhixia 100,000 yuan)

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.740
(Debtor: Xu Zhidong)

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.460
Your dad and I made him write it.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.820
But the interest

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.860
he added that himself.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.780
No one asked him to.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.740
Look at your brother.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.380
He really is becoming more thoughtful.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.980
He is starting to act like a man.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.740
Yes.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.260
Zhixia.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.300
Let me tell you.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.980
Your dad and I

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.460
reflected on ourselves.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.500
Both our children matter to us.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.140
We should treat you equally.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.380
That is what parents should do.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.420
We should not rely on seniority

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.560
and we should not take from one
to give to the other.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.540
Look.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.020
Look at you now.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.660
You have your own family.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.900
You and Zhang Hao
are building your own life.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.740
Jiao also needs to be raised
and now you have a second baby coming.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.420
We just...

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.460
Right, you can
give birth naturally, yes?

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.900
You are of advanced maternal age.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.100
I know I am of advanced age.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.300
I know.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.500
All right. Keep...

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.500
Keep that IOU safe.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.340
When is Xu Zhidong planning to repay me?

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.100
Repay...

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.660
All right, I know. Keep it for me.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.220
I am leaving.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.060
Mingzhu.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.820
The bangle is repaired perfectly.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.020
I will bring it to you now.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.180
Thank you, Zhixia.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.700
I am having dinner at my in-laws' today.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.300
I was just worrying about it.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.300
Give me a moment.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.140
Mingzhu.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.460
Mom.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.340
Why are you here?

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.940
I just finished my spa treatment.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.580
I saw it was nearly
the end of your shift,

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.540
so I asked the driver
to swing by and pick you up.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.500
We can go home together.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.420
No, I have not finished my work yet.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.820
Please go back and rest first.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.820
I can walk home later.
It is very convenient.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.980
Walk home for what?

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.620
I am already here. I will wait for you.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.860
This is my way of showing care.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:03.540
Understand?

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.340
Then how about this.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.980
I will book you a private room
on the second floor.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.980
You can rest there first.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:08.620
I am not going.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.100
I will sit right here.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.740
My husband, Feng,

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.820
is an important client of Nanxi Hotel.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.740
I would like to see
who dares say no to me.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.180
I will wait for you.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.060
Pour me a cup of tea.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.860
Yes, madam.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.900
(It is over.)

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.540
It is over. My mother-in-law is here.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.980
Miss Zhang, you are looking at jade.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.940
Do not look aimlessly
and buy recklessly.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:49.980
Let me tell you.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.220
There are so many fakes nowadays.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.980
If you buy, you must buy something good.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.380
Let me show you the one from my family.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:57.620
Mingzhu.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.860
Come here.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.620
Show Aunt Zhang your bangle.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.980
Come on.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.060
- Wait a moment.
- Where is this water coming from?

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.900
Lobby manager!

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:08.500
Lobby manager!

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.420
Let me tell you.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.500
Nanxi Hotel
is not doing well these days.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.420
Guests are shouting everywhere.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.020
There is no manners at all.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.180
Why is there water all over the floor?

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.860
I am a pregnant woman.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.340
If I slip and something happens,

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.620
you will have to compensate.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.860
Thank your mom for me.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.500
Sorry. Please calm down.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:25.860
- Calm down.
- I am furious.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.500
All right.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.740
My daughter in law works here.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.940
We told her to change jobs,
but she would not listen.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.140
There is no choice.
She is a girl from a modest family.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.340
She cannot be persuaded.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:37.740
Come.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.340
Let me show you.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:41.980
Come.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.260
Have a look.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.420
See this?

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.140
This is proper jade.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.860
High transparency. It even glows.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.860
- It has grown a lot.
- Mingzhu.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.860
Come. Dinner is ready.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.060
Coming.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.740
Come. Eat. Mingzhu is here.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.420
Come, Mingzhu.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:57.940
- Dad is back.
- Come.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.140
Let me tell you.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.380
Dad brought goose wings
back from Guangzhou.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.820
- These goose wings are famous.
- They taste amazing. Try one.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.940
Everyone gets one.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:07.940
- Yours.
- Thank you, Mom.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.700
I do not want it. Do not serve me.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.740
I can use my own hands.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.420
You child.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.460
Mom is happy to serve you a little.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.420
You really do not know
how lucky you are.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:17.260
I know.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.780
Let me share some good news.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.420
At the order fair
in Guangzhou this time,

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.940
I secured several big contracts.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.880
We may be busy
in the second half of the year.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:30.980
So matters at home,

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.350
I will rely on all of you.

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:33.860
Feng.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.220
In my view,

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.900
we should bring in a managing director

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.380
and let him run the company.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.220
You are not young any more,

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:41.820
right?

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.260
You should come home
and enjoy tending your flowers,

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.580
spend time
with the grandchild and enjoy life.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.460
Raising a grandchild costs money.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.460
How about this, Feng?

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:52.940
You retire,

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.540
and I take over the family business.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.220
You?

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.540
You should start from the front line.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.740
Gain enough experience
before coming back to help Dad.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.320
- Mom is right.
- Who are you looking down on?

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.660
By the way, Mingzhu.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.900
How many weeks is the baby now?

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.180
Almost fourteen weeks.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.580
You are very precise, Feng.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.260
Most men just ask
how many months she is pregnant.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.580
That is Feng.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.700
Who else would it be?

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:17.740
Your dad

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.180
takes everything very seriously.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.300
Back when we were
in the textile factory,

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.340
he worked his way up
from the workshop to the general office.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.920
He could always pick things up
and put them down with ease.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.380
That is why when we started
the company later,

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:31.860
everything fell into place.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.140
Back then Jianqi always said

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.300
Dad is amazing.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.500
Whatever he does, he succeeds.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.340
No.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:38.820
Just a moment.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.660
Miss Mao, is the soup ready?

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:42.540
Yes.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.580
Great, bring it over.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.060
This is tasty.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:48.540
Isn't it?

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.140
Yes, it is.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:50.100
Mingzhu.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.900
I heard we ran out of fish maw at home.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:52.900
I bought some.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.520
Not sure if it is suitable. Have a look.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:55.740
Thank you, Dad.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:56.660
Mingzhu,

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.500
this fish maw is very good for you.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.220
You should keep eating it.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:01.900
I bought a few feeding bottles.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:02.780
See which one works best.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:03.900
You even bought feeding bottles?

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:04.340
I bought several.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.900
Feng, you really came prepared.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.660
You are going to be a grandpa after all.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:08.660
Such attention to detail.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.300
You even bought bottles.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:10.820
Different stages.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.420
Mingzhu.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.220
I know this feeding bottle.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.300
Let me tell you, it is a new product.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.020
It withstands heat and drops.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.020
- Is that so?
- I am not too sure myself.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.300
This is great.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.420
Feng, you are making me jealous.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.980
I could never forget you, my lady.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.580
Tiffany.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.980
- Thank you, Feng.
- Look how thrilled she is.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.780
This is wonderful, look.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.300
Mingzhu has her ancestral bangle,

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.980
and Meiqi now has her new bracelet.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.100
This is what you call
the best of both worlds.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.020
And you are not forgotten, Madam Feng.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.620
Here, this is a pearl bracelet.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:51.860
- Thank you.
- This suits you perfectly.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.700
Mom, open it and show us.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.380
Let us see.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.100
Look at mine.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.140
- Looks lovely.
- It really does.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.820
Our family has been through
quite a lot this year.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.180
It has been tough.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.140
We owe you a great deal, Madam Feng.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:07.420
Thank you.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.580
Look at what you are saying.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.180
Isn't that what I should do?

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:15.740
Thank you.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.620
All right.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.660
Today is a happy day.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:21.020
Yes.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:21.980
Let us

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.260
eat.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.420
Let us take a photo.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.380
All right.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:25.740
Come.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:26.980
Come on.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:27.700
Look at me.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.500
Come on.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.380
Three, two, one.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.100
Zhilu.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.500
Zhilu.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:54.950
What are you looking at?

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.180
I told you this family is odd.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.340
They show off nonstop.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.740
They even managed
to fix Mingzhu's bangle.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:14.900
Repaired so perfectly.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.300
A museum should hire them
to restore artifacts.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.260
What a waste otherwise.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:20.740
Such a waste.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.020
Enough.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.260
They are helping Mingzhu, aren't they?

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.580
What good are those bitter
remarks of yours?

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.700
Yes, they have the ability.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.580
They can help Mingzhu.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:29.540
I cannot help with anything.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.260
I am nothing.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.020
All I did was give you
a defective child.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:32.620
Enough?

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:36.420
What then?

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.760
That defective child
has nothing to do with me, is that it?

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:39.980
Yes, nothing to do with you.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:41.980
I…

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:43.700
Are you daft?

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:45.780
Xiang.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.260
Where are you?

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.460
Upstairs.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:53.980
Why are you calling me?

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:57.380
Lovely.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.500
These things,

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.860
aren't they supposed
to be provided by the bride's family?

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.060
We as the groom's side
also need things for the bed, right?

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.340
And

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.540
it is different now.
Men and women are the same.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:11.820
The same my foot.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.140
The same? So why

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.060
do we men still have to
pay the betrothal money?

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:15.500
You…

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.500
When Zhang Hao married Zhixia,

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.060
we did not even mention betrothal money.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.140
Zhang Hao's family had their own flat.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.420
Do we have one?

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:23.740
We do not.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:25.660
Poor folk.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.180
You are the poor folk.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.980
But Bichen's mom already said

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.860
that once we give the money over,

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:34.460
she will pass it on to the young couple.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.620
Those two, if I may say,
know what they are doing.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:37.460
Yes.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.060
Right.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.580
Bichen's parents
know what they are doing.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.180
They really do.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.060
- They do.
- Very much so.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:46.940
Yes, exactly.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.060
What are you doing?

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.140
You are getting everything dirty.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.340
Do not touch that.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.860
It is dirty. Your hands are dirty too.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.820
This is the token of love
I made for Chen.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:57.860
This is lovely.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.820
Didn't we go to buy rings that day?

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.820
Chen didn't choose the diamond one.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.380
She chose this pair of gold ones.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.580
To be honest,
I could tell straight away.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.340
Chen liked that six-prong diamond ring.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.780
She just wanted to save me money.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:10.940
My finances aren't great.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.540
So I'll make up for it with effort.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:14.340
Look.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.020
Bichen is a good girl.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.300
Yes, she really is a lovely child.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:19.140
Mom.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:20.980
Bichen's parents said

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.860
they want to find a time to come over.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.260
To discuss the wedding banquet date
with you both again.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.420
They want to come over?

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.020
Come over...

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:32.660
Why are you looking at me?

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.100
Answer your son.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.620
No problem.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.540
No problem. They are welcome.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:40.500
- Right.
- Yes.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.620
I will let Bichen know.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.140
Good. Tell her.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:43.820
All right.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.100
Good. Let's start cooking.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:45.900
Good. All right.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.100
All right.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:03.420
Thank you.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.220
You are welcome.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.580
Here. You have some too.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.100
(Best wishes to dear Dad, Mr. Li Bohai,
on his seventieth birthday.)

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.060
Just look at you.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.500
You look so strong and healthy.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:10.740
Mingzhu.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.020
Mingzhu.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.980
Uncle.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:21.620
Long time no see.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.380
Jingzhe is here.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.420
Jingzhe really does have some ability.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.660
Uncle. Happy birthday.
Wishing you good health.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.300
Jingzhe, listen to me.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.180
Your thoughtfulness is enough.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.380
Keep the money.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.300
Young people have many expenses.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:33.780
No.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.380
You should know I have
nowhere to spend money.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:36.180
No. You keep it.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:37.300
Dad.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.220
This is Jingzhe's goodwill.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.020
- How could we not accept it?
- Yes.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:41.620
Listen.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:42.540
I will keep it for you.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.660
It is your birthday today.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:45.900
Jingzhe.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.180
Look.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.540
All the elders are sitting here.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.940
It is not suitable for you to sit here.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.260
There is an empty seat over there.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.380
Go and sit there.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:53.660
Alright.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:54.900
They are all the younger ones.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:55.900
Do not overthink it.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.080
Really. Do not overthink it.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.180
Little one is here.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.060
Come.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:02.100
Come here.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.180
Wish Grandpa a happy birthday.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.140
Call her Auntie.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:15.300
Mom.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:18.860
I am going to the toilet.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.260
You're annoying.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.700
Shall we invite
Chen's parents over tomorrow?

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:27.460
You...

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.620
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.180
The furniture and everything

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.700
is not even fully bought yet.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.540
Wait a few more days.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.140
Still a few more days.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:40.980
Mom, tell me the truth.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.940
Is it about my betrothal money?

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:44.500
You child...

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.180
You really go all out.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.500
No. What is happening to me?

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.420
My menopause has already ended.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.540
Happy birthday, Dad.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:01.860
Dad, happy birthday.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.380
Thank you.

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:08.980
Dad.

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.500
Have some more.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:11.380
Alright.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:12.940
Have more. Eat more.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:13.620
Alright.

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:14.180
Dad.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.420
It is such a good day today.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.420
Say a few words.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.740
Alright. I will listen to you

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:19.540
and say something.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:21.660
Do not be angry later.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:22.660
Why would I be angry?

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.540
Everyone, hold on a moment.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.220
Listen to my dad say a few words.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.500
Alright.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.460
(Longevity)

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:34.700
Let me say a few words.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.740
Thank you to all my family and friends

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.860
for taking the time

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.620
to come and celebrate my birthday.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.180
I am truly grateful.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.460
Thank you.

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:47.660
Alright.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.220
Time does not come back.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.300
In the blink of an eye, I am seventy.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.180
This whole journey

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.660
has been full of ups and downs.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.500
To say life has no regrets

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:04.780
would be a lie.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.260
But today

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.740
when I look at the younger ones,

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:12.780
I feel content.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.940
What makes me the proudest in my life

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.060
is my nephew,

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.300
Jingzhe.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.260
He

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.220
has impeccable character.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:27.860
And to me,

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.780
he is unfailingly good.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:31.900
Dad.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.620
Your own son is right here.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:34.740
Why are you only praising him?

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.180
What do you mean by that?

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.460
These past two years,

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.060
I managed to save a bit of money.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.220
I thought

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.780
at this stage of my life,

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.220
I have eaten well and dressed well.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:52.020
And I have

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.220
tried everything worth trying.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.860
So I decided to donate that money

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.540
to the Children's Home.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:01.300
It is not much,

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:02.780
just my small gesture.

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:03.980
Dad.

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.420
Why didn't you discuss this with me?

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:06.980
Let me finish.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.180
Jingzhe.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:12.620
Come. Come here.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:13.460
Come.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.740
No. I am not going up.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.340
There is one last small matter.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.820
I have an insurance policy.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.140
The beneficiary is Jingzhe.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:23.860
I just think that

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:24.900
- Dad.
- when I pass away later...

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:25.780
I am your son.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:26.740
Why are you giving it to him?

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:27.700
I want Jingzhe

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.700
to donate that money as well,

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.500
so it can go to those

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.500
who truly need it.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.020
That will fulfill my last wish.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:36.380
No.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:37.060
Don't...

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.620
Jingzhe.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.540
Can you tell me

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.540
why you sold your own flat

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:47.380
last month?

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.260
No. We won't talk
about the second stage.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.340
We'll talk later, all right?

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:52.540
The second stage?

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:54.580
I already know.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.580
I just don't know how much more money

00:19:58.580 --> 00:19:59.700
and effort it will take.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.340
No. Wait a moment.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.220
What second stage?

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.360
What are you two hinting at?

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.420
What second stage?

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.220
Stage two of liver cancer.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.220
Jingzhe...

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.620
He sold the flat

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.260
to pay for my treatment.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.380
Uncle.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.460
You can't drink now.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:32.420
Believe me.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:33.620
Just one last glass.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:38.900
What do you mean?

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:40.580
What are you up to?

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:41.900
When I asked you, you dodged it.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:42.820
You kept avoiding my questions.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:43.460
I'm telling you,

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:44.340
today you must give me an answer.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.540
Family members,
please follow us to bring out the cake.

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:46.780
Why are you here again?

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:47.900
Can't you see I'm handling something?

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:48.500
Stop shouting, will you?

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.260
Why are you everywhere?

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:49.660
Why can't I shout?

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:50.300
I'll complain about you next time.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.140
Why can't I shout?

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.140
Miss.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.180
Come here.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.180
This shredded tofu dish,

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.340
I've eaten it in your restaurant
for twenty years.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.420
It has never once gone wrong.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.100
As long as you enjoy it.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.460
Dr. Li

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.460
specifically asked us
to prepare it for you.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.340
All right.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.300
Then please

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.260
take Jingzhe with you

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.300
and bring my cake over.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:19.740
All right?

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:20.620
Yes. No problem.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:21.950
- Thank you.
- You can rely on us.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:23.020
Brother.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:24.540
Is what Jingzhe said true?

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.340
Let's go, Dr. Li.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.220
When did this happen?

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.060
Why didn't you tell us?

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:34.300
Come on.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.860
Didn't you say we're getting the cake?

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:38.540
You're so naive.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.860
If you bring the cake back now,

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.980
you'll walk straight back into the trap.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:44.300
Didn't you see

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.860
your uncle was trying to get you out.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.660
Life really is dramatic.

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.500
Good things and bad things link together

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:02.940
and trap people step by step.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.460
I didn't expect your story
to be this dramatic too.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.020
Today went far beyond what I imagined.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.300
I didn't want anything this dramatic.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.380
I just wanted a simple life.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.620
Yet today

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.380
the heavens seem
determined to overwhelm me.

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:24.940
Yes.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.940
It arrived without a sound.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.580
Not a hint or warning.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.460
Isn't it like when you're hosting

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.620
and they suddenly tell you
the programme changed,

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.420
so the host must improvise on the spot?

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.860
My mind just went blank.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.220
What could you do?

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:44.940
Even without preparation,

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.780
you still have to finish your lines.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.220
How is it, sister?

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.540
No wonder your stomach hurt so badly

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:56.980
and you were bleeding.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.420
Your coil has grown into the flesh.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.380
I forgot. I really forgot about it.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:06.820
You women

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.180
look after everyone else

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.780
except yourselves.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.020
It has been over two years
since menopause.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.140
Removing it now is much more difficult.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.500
So what should I do, Zhou?

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.860
What else?
Go to the hospital to have it removed.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.140
I still have to go to the hospital?

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.300
Zhou.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.980
Is the operation major or minor?

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:30.940
Minor.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.540
A minor one. You can leave right after.

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.300
Then why go to a big hospital?

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.620
It's packed with people

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.580
and wait in line for everything.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:40.940
It's such a hassle.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.340
And it's expensive too, isn't it?

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:47.500
Zhou.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:50.300
Can you remove the coil?

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.580
I can remove it.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.820
But many people don't dare to...

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:55.500
I dare.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.420
Really, I do.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.860
You don't know what's happening at home.

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.180
My son is about to get married.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.540
There's so much
waiting for me to handle.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:06.780
If I go to the hospital,

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.460
I'll lose a whole day.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:09.380
I dare. I really do.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.260
Sister, I dare.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.580
If you dare, I dare.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.300
I used to work as a midwife
in the countryside.

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.460
I delivered so many babies
with my bare hands.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.580
A tiny coil is nothing.

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:19.260
Really?

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.220
Let's do it.

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:24.340
Come.

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:25.940
Zhou.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.580
Why haven't you started yet?

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.180
Even a small operation
is still an operation.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.620
I need to disinfect everything
and be responsible for you.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.540
Thank you, sister.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.380
Just please be quick.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.700
Or I won't make it back in time

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.540
to cook for them.

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:44.150
Look at the situation you're in.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.260
And you're still thinking
about cooking for others.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.140
Let's begin.

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:48.580
Alright.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:49.460
Legs apart.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:50.860
Don't be nervous.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.780
It'll be over soon.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:54.780
It might hurt a little.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:58.740
Pain has never scared me.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.020
Don't move. Don't tense up.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:04.980
Almost.

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.820
Alright, the coil is out.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:14.940
Wait a moment.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.100
There seems to be a small stone
growing beside it.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:20.660
Bear with it for a bit.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:21.980
I'll pull it out.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:22.620
Alright.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.420
Pull it. Pull it. Pull it.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:34.340
Oh no.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:36.940
She's bleeding.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.060
Don't panic. Stay calm.

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:43.780
I'll call emergency services.

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.580
Auntie, wake up.

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:51.420
You mustn't sleep.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:52.420
Auntie.

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:53.940
Auntie.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.860
Who are you?

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.140
I'm a doctor, auntie.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.700
We're taking you to the hospital now.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:04.700
We'll be there very soon.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:14.660
I still have so much to do.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.340
Maybe I should go back.

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.180
Avoiding it won't help.

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.900
What about the cake? Is the cake real?

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:22.380
Of course the cake is real.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:23.380
Let's go.

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:26.460
I need to take this call.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.520
I need to take a call too.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:29.100
Hello.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.180
Hello, Zhixia.

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.270
Where's the doctor on duty?

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.410
Have they taken her
to the People's Hospital?

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:36.740
Didn't I say earlier

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:37.780
- my uncle's birthday is today?
- Calm down.

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:38.780
I'm going over right now.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.080
I need to get to the hospital.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:43.900
Can I get a lift with you?

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.180
I need to go to the hospital too.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:47.780
Zhixia's mom is bleeding heavily

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.210
and has been taken to your hospital.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.020
Please help keep an eye on her later.

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:51.580
Alright.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.340
Is heavy bleeding dangerous?

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.020
Hard to say yet.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:55.700
We'll know when we see her.
The sooner the better.

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:56.220
Alright.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:03.900
Zhixia.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.420
I've reached the hospital.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.220
Where's the emergency department?

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:07.900
That way.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.420
Alright. I'm heading to emergency now.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.020
Toothbrush, toothpaste and a towel.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.180
Right, there are new socks
in the drawer.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:15.780
Bring them.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:17.480
My mom likes to wear socks
when she sleeps.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.420
Drop the things off first.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.780
Then pick up Jiao, alright?

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.460
I'll go down and get them.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:25.500
The plasma's here.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.620
Where's the rest?

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:27.540
Another twenty minutes.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:28.460
Not sure if it'll be enough.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:29.380
Alright. Hurry.

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:30.340
If it's not enough, use mine.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.100
Me too.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:32.260
I can donate as well.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.740
What's your relation to the patient?

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.260
We're her children.

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:37.860
Direct relatives
donating blood is risky.

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.210
And your blood types might not match.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:39.860
Nurse.

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:41.380
I'm her husband.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.100
We have the same blood type.

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:43.900
Can I donate?

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:44.980
Yes. Come with me.

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:45.780
Alright.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.180
Dad, I...

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:48.900
Don't follow me.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:49.820
Stay with your mom.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:57.500
Don't worry too much. She'll be fine.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:58.740
Sit.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.700
(This day and this moment)

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:13.940
(made me realise that with this family,)

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:17.220
(our lives are tied together
by blood and there's no escaping it.)

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.620
(A peaceful home brings prosperity)

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:29.220
Pass it to me.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:30.500
What do you want?

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:38.180
Didn't our daughter say

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:39.470
she'd be home for dinner tonight?

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.380
Why isn't she back yet?

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:41.980
She's probably busy these days.

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.140
Didn't she mention some banquet?

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:45.420
That's what I think.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:46.500
Mom.

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:49.540
Mom, Mingzhu said
she'll be back later tonight.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:50.460
What?

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.300
Her biological mother
is in emergency care.

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:54.820
What happened?

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.660
She's had massive bleeding.

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:57.620
It's serious.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.700
What do you mean, massive bleeding?

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:00.620
Was it a car accident?

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:01.380
No.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.060
She was having a ring removed.

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:06.740
Alright, I know.

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:07.840
I'm going upstairs.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:12.700
Removing the ring?

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.540
Dr. Li, how is she?

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:19.340
She's stabilized.

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:21.500
Dr. Li.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:22.700
Thank you so much.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.620
You've saved our family's life.

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:25.500
You're welcome, uncle.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.180
It's my duty.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:26.700
Mom.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.500
Be gentle. She's not awake yet.

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:29.860
Alright, I know.

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:30.580
Thank you.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.740
How many days does she need to stay?

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:32.660
Depends on her recovery.

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:33.540
Probably a week.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.140
Uncle, go with them.

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:36.180
Thank you, Dr. Li.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:36.780
Thank you.

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:37.380
Mom.

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:38.860
- Mom.
- Xiang.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.100
Dr. Li.

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:42.940
When my wife is discharged,
I'll buy you a drink.

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:43.700
Alright, uncle.

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:44.860
Alright. See you later.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:45.300
Thank you.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:45.820
Uncle.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:46.780
Go on.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:47.380
Alright.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.820
This Yu Jingxiang is...

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:06.140
I honestly cannot figure it out.

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:09.060
Xu Dacheng and his wife
are already at their age.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.380
Why are they
still having the ring removed?

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.740
And ending up bleeding like that?

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:14.660
Goodness me.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.980
This woman is just...

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:18.660
Far too much trouble.

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:20.380
Women are trouble.

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.160
Once men are involved
it becomes even worse.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:23.980
Bleeding during pregnancy.

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.020
Bleeding after an abortion.

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:26.060
Bleeding from ring removal.

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:27.460
Giving birth bleeds even more.

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:29.780
Nothing good ever comes from it
when men are involved.

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:32.820
Why are you so fired up?

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:35.260
I do not understand, so I am asking you.

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:35.900
Asking what?

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.620
It is easy for men to become fathers.

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:38.340
But women…

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:39.740
We risk our lives every single time.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.260
Why are you so angry?

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:44.620
Dad, Mom.

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.380
I am back.

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:47.660
My girl is home.

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:48.580
Dad.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:49.740
Come on, dinner is ready.

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.980
Your mom
even simmered chicken soup for you.

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.060
I am starving.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:58.020
Mom, you made chicken soup?

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:02.940
Look, it is still hot.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:04.900
Do not eat the leftovers.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.220
This is the portion saved for you.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:08.220
I thought Yu

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.580
would treat you to a big dinner.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:11.980
Nothing tastes better
than home-cooked food.

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:18.460
So how is she now?

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.280
She just made it past the danger period.

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:22.150
Dr. Li said she needs
to stay for observation.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.470
She still needs ongoing treatment.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:24.820
It is that serious?

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.520
Then who is staying
with her in hospital?

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.660
Zhidong is staying tonight

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:29.660
and Zhixia will take tomorrow.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:30.860
The two of them are taking turns.

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.500
Her son does not understand anything.

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.540
And her daughter

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.980
is pregnant with her second child.

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:36.900
What about her husband?

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:37.820
Is he doing nothing?

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.580
Yes, that Xu Dacheng…

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:41.220
He really is unreliable.

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:44.760
Serves him right.

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:46.450
He does not
even look after his own child.

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.540
What are you doing?

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.380
Why are you taking the chicken?

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:53.580
There's already chicken
simmering in the pot.

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:54.980
It's all cooked into soup.

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:56.500
Why so many questions?

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:57.860
Isn't that for our daughter?

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.700
This one's for that poor woman.

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.900
I must have owed her in a past life.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:06.340
I'll never repay it in this one.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:07.820
Mom.

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:09.500
You really are beautiful and kind.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.420
What did you say?

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:11.540
Beautiful and kind.

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:12.700
I've had a brain puncture.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:13.700
Beautiful and kind...

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:15.750
There's something wrong with me.

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:40.140
Zhidong.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:41.820
Are you staying at the hospital tonight?

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:43.460
I will bring you some food.

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:45.460
No need.

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:49.020
I don't want to eat anything.

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:49.940
I've no appetite.

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:54.580
I've been terrified these past two days.

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:57.100
I almost lost my mom.

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.660
Chen, I'll talk to you later.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:06.660
Mom.

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.020
Mom.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:10.940
Mom.

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:17.260
Mom.

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:18.540
Mom.

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.580
(Third One Building)

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:54.140
(Teachers' Office)

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:01.300
Minghui.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.320
- Come over.
- Come on.

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.580
- You go over there.
- Go on.

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.180
Should I catch up on maths first

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:11.860
or physics first?

00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:13.020
Teachers.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.380
Why don't you two have a little contest?

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:17.660
Look at him.

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.580
He really thinks he's a treasure.

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:28.980
Start with physics.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:31.700
I'm going to the cafeteria for a meal.

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:36.900
What are you doing?

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.460
Mr. Sun.

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.620
I was too impulsive when I complained

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:43.660
to the headmaster last time.

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:45.260
I'm sorry.

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.060
So you do know it was wrong.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:51.380
Let me tell you.

00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:53.220
I was young once too.

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:54.700
But what you did…

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:55.540
I know.

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:58.420
That's why
I came to apologise in person.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.140
I've got high blood pressure,
high blood sugar and high cholesterol.

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:02.940
I know.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.460
I braised this myself.

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:05.700
I chose lean meat on purpose.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:07.220
Low oil and low sugar.

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:10.220
Thank you.

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:11.540
Start with physics.

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:12.700
I'm going to the cafeteria.

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:13.380
Go eat first.

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.300
Goodbye, Mr. Sun.

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:15.580
Okay.

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:16.820
Minghui.

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:18.300
Bring that small stool over.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.020
Show me yesterday's

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.020
mock exam paper.

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:33.900
(Shen's Pork Chops. Limited Supply)
The chops are sold out.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:35.060
Stop queuing.

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.100
- Sold out.
- None left.

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:39.740
They sold out this fast.

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:41.300
One serving of rice.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:49.780
What dish is that?

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:50.900
Aubergine. Braised aubergine.

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:51.780
No.

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:52.940
This one.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.180
One portion of tomato and egg.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:54.860
Alright.

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:58.020
No lotus root?

00:35:58.180 --> 00:35:59.140
There is. Here.

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:00.290
Yes, give me some lotus root.

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:05.900
I've still got a chop left.

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:07.380
Okay. Thank you.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:10.700
Let me tell you.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.580
You can order more pork chops each day.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:14.660
- Right?
- Right.

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:15.460
Yes.

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.140
The students love them.

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:18.340
Yes, they do.

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:22.500
Look.

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.180
L2 is cut.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.460
F2 disappears.

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:30.460
Then the small ball
will swing down, won't it?

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:33.900
And once it swings down,
the tension in L1

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.300
will change, won't it?

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.660
Now that we know this condition,

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:39.860
this next question should
be easy to pick, shouldn't it?

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:41.340
Which one?

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:56.300
Shen Minghui.

00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:00.020
You don't pass exams by praying.

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:01.900
You're very bright.

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.220
So why can't you put that energy

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:05.700
into studying?

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.460
Lu Bing has strong grades.

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.700
So you should work even harder

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.860
and try to catch up with her,
shouldn't you?

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:16.020
Mr. Hu.

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:18.940
Your grades were excellent.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.100
So why are you still single?

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:28.980
Quiet down.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.140
Stop worrying about whether L2 or L1

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:36.140
will change.

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:38.660
Will Feng Meiqi change?

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:42.510
Look at the question.

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:43.580
Which one?

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:44.900
C.

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:55.700
Mom.

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:57.860
You look much better today.

00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:58.460
Okay.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.460
Higher? Is that okay?

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:00.660
Yes, son.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:02.020
That's good.

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:08.700
My son has worked so hard.

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:09.500
It's fine.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.060
Wipe your hands.

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:12.880
Your sister will be here soon,
then we'll eat.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:24.100
Zhidong.

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:24.940
Zhixia.

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:26.380
Hurry, go home and rest.

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:26.750
I'm here.

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.740
I… I don't think I'll make it to work.

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:31.540
It's still early,
you can sleep for half an hour.

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:32.580
Yes, at noon

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.700
take a short nap at the office.

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:35.740
Mom, stop worrying.

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:36.860
Our shift is easy.

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:37.420
All right.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.700
Zhixia, pour the water, please.

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:39.660
Slow down.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.020
Yes, a bit slower.

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:43.460
Your son

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:44.900
has really grown sensible.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.700
Of course, he's my boy.

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:55.140
This is the fish soup
my dad made for you.

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.540
He didn't add any MSG. Have a smell.

00:38:58.940 --> 00:38:59.580
Too oily.

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:02.500
Drink a little. It's good for nutrition.

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:11.820
Mingzhu.

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:13.700
You're here.

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:15.820
My mom made some chicken soup.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:16.980
It's really nourishing.

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.180
Your... Your mom…

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:23.260
Your mom brought chicken soup for me?

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:27.540
Your mom is such a kind person.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:30.060
I need to thank her.

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:32.260
Please thank her for me later.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:32.900
Okay.

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:34.620
I'll ladle you a bowl.

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:37.420
Go ahead.

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:52.940
Here.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:58.980
It smells wonderful.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:02.020
It really does smell wonderful.

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:14.140
It tastes good.

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:17.020
It's really good.

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:18.980
I served my mom fish soup earlier,

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.150
and she said it was too oily.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.300
There's a drumstick too.

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:25.700
Go on and eat it, all right?

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:29.500
Okay, okay.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:41.380
All my life,

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.620
I've never eaten a drumstick.

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:53.340
Delicious.

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.100
Delicious.

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:01.100
Delicious.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.340
I went through
the gates of death this time.

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:10.300
It was worth it.

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:14.940
Worth it.

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:20.980
Mingzhu.

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.180
You don't look very pregnant at all.

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:25.420
The baby's there.

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:27.180
It really is.

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:30.700
Thank you for today.

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:32.140
Once you arrived,

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.180
Madam Yu suddenly looked much better.

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:36.540
You said it yourself.

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:38.360
We don't need
to be so polite with each other.

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:43.980
To be honest, my mom

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:45.980
has had a hard life.

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:49.020
She wasn't exaggerating at all just now.

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.700
She really has never eaten a drumstick.

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.420
The family was poor back then.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:56.150
They couldn't afford it.

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.220
After Zhidong and I were born,

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:00.700
she had to put us first.

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:04.220
Over time, she simply got used to it.

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:05.420
It became muscle memory.

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:06.820
She'd think she

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.860
liked chewing on necks
or gnawing on feet.

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:12.860
My mom is the same.

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:14.660
Growing up,

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:17.020
the drumsticks always
went to my brother and me.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.020
Yes.

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.180
Same world,

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.100
same kind of mom.

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:27.580
Oh, right.

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:29.340
Something was odd today.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.580
Your mom actually made soup for my mom.

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:34.580
She's sharp-tongued but soft-hearted.

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.140
Without my mom,

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:39.860
I wouldn't have dared to keep this baby.

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.340
And I definitely wouldn't have dared
to be a single mom.
