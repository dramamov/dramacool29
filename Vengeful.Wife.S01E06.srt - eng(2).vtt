00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.679
Sirs,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.079
you...

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.904
(Ye Dong, new CEO of Jiuyao Group
is a Live-in Son-in-Law)

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:09.280
Mr. Cheng,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.180
Mr. Ye Dong is asking to see you.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.299
(He has been so moody lately.)

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.640
(That look in his eyes)

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:18.719
(scared me to death.)

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.379
Should

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.459
I send him in?

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.980
Show Mr. Ye in.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.379
Right away.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.859
Hello.

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:46.099
Mr. Cheng will see you now.

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:50.260
Wait here.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.099
Have a seat.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.500
Ye Dong,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.379
what brings you here?

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.340
What a wonderful surprise!

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:15.900
When I passed by earlier,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.500
the sign read Cheng Nuo.

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:18.780
My gut told me

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.699
it is you,

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.939
so I dropped in.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.699
You...

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.500
I must admit,

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:25.379
your gut is sharp.

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.099
I just saw the news

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.060
that

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.699
you're taking over Jiuyao Group.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.020
Who would've thought?

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.699
You're the Lin family's son-in-law!

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.979
Your good fortune

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.580
makes me jealous.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.740
Are you mocking me too?

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.740
Not at all.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.780
You really

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.699
make me jealous.

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:48.020
You'll be a father.

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:49.500
How are your wife and child?

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.460
What's wrong?

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.020
Bai Cha fell off

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.020
a cliff recently.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.060
She survived,

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:06.979
but the child

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.300
didn't...

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.379
What?

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:11.900
How could this happen?

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.180
Let me tell you,

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:18.479
I wish it had been me instead.

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.740
Cheng Nuo,

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.379
don't you dare think that way.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.219
You're both

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.340
still young.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.020
You can have another child.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.340
I'll never

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:33.900
have another child.

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:35.939
One wife,

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.240
one child. That's all.

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:42.500
Wait.

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.020
How did you know about the child?

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.939
I never mentioned it.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.419
Lin Xia told me.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.139
Women talk about everything

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:03.060
among themselves.

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:07.620
That explains it.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.460
Right.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.259
For a moment there,

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.819
I almost

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.860
suspected something going on

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.019
between you and Bai Cha.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.180
Now,

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:22.300
don't spread nonsense.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.980
Bai Cha

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.259
wouldn't appreciate it.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.180
And if Lin Xia found out,

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.139
she'd run wild beyond control.

00:04:30.579 --> 00:04:31.660
Just joking with you.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.660
No need to panic.

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:34.339
Let me make this clear.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.300
I trust Bai Cha completely.

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:38.100
She loves me deeply,

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:40.899
and since we got together,

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:44.879
she's never betrayed me.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.579
What?

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:55.699
Nothing.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.779
Just think

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:00.779
her devotion to you

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:02.420
is truly admirable.

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:04.459
Absolutely.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.379
You don't know
how we cherish each other.

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:09.019
How to put it...

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.920
Our love

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:14.759
is earth-shatteringly intense.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.180
Let me spell it out.

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:18.339
If anything happened to her,

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:20.300
I'd trade my life

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:22.220
for hers in a heartbeat.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:24.459
Never imagined

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.420
you'd be such a rare man.

00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:28.019
By the way,

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:30.180
how's

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:31.579
her recovery?

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:32.939
Which hospital?

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:34.899
I want to visit her with Lin Xia.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.000
She's in...

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.959
She's in...

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:44.060
Never mind.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.779
By the way.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.220
I heard

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.420
Lin Xia was in a car accident

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:51.819
and lost her eyesight.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.899
As patients,

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.279
what could they talk about?

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.100
Comparing

00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:57.779
their medical conditions?

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:03.060
You and I

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.100
are brothers in misery now.

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:07.139
But since Bai Cha's hospitalized,

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:09.300
we should at least visit.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.819
Right?

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.579
I appreciate it.

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:14.620
What she needs most right now

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.540
is peace and quiet to recover.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:19.779
When she's better,

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.180
I'll take her

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.420
to meet both of you.

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:24.300
Okay.

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:25.740
It's settled then.

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:27.620
I'll let you get back to it.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.860
Meet another day.

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:30.339
I won't walk you out.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.579
Tied up with a surgery.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.100
No need

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.779
for formalities.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.819
I'll head out.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.579
Cheng Nuo,

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.220
about the child,

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:50.779
it's truly heartbreaking.

00:07:32.512 --> 00:07:34.074
(Ye Dong)

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.339
Bai Cha,

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:49.259
in this lifetime,

00:07:50.259 --> 00:07:52.379
you'll never escape my grasp.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:57.420
Mom,

00:07:57.819 --> 00:07:58.779
what's going on?

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:00.579
This isn't my fault.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:01.819
She had to

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:02.860
run around

00:08:02.939 --> 00:08:04.139
and slipped herself.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.259
There's a board meeting tomorrow.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.100
If any complications arise,

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.339
it'll ruin my plans.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.139
Rest assured.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.500
Just a minor issue.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.300
She passed out.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:16.740
She'll wake up soon.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:17.779
Dong,

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.220
bad news.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.060
Go on.

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:24.100
Currently,

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.420
someone's spreading rumors

00:08:25.579 --> 00:08:26.480
using the case,

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.560
calling you unworthy.

00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:29.579
Jiuyao Group's stock

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.439
keeps plummeting.

00:08:31.259 --> 00:08:32.460
This poses serious risks to

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:33.700
your inauguration.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.419
If I ever find out

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:39.200
who stabbed me in the back,

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:41.440
I'll make sure they regret being born.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.019
I clearly changed your fate already.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.700
How could this still happen?

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.940
I understand now.

00:08:49.539 --> 00:08:51.259
Lin Yuanshan

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.259
is still clinging to life.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.779
Only by eliminating him

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.620
will your prosperous destiny manifest.

00:08:59.059 --> 00:09:00.700
So he must die.

00:09:01.419 --> 00:09:02.419
Must die.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.220
Dong,

00:09:09.659 --> 00:09:10.659
what should we do now?

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.740
Use the group's authority

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.460
to make the police clarify it.

00:09:15.139 --> 00:09:16.259
Notify the legal department

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.399
to sue all rumor-spreading

00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:20.139
social platforms and official accounts.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.179
Understood.

00:09:22.379 --> 00:09:23.059
But

00:09:23.539 --> 00:09:24.240
I suggest

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.019
we find the original victim

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.600
and have him clarify in person.

00:09:28.019 --> 00:09:28.740
So the impact

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.100
would be stronger.

00:09:31.539 --> 00:09:32.220
I see.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:33.500
Handle that first.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:33.899
Alright.

00:09:56.059 --> 00:09:57.620
Want to try something exciting?

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.059
What do you mean?

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.720
Come to my place right now.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.620
It's so late.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.460
Not a good idea.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.539
In 20 minutes,

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.539
if you aren't here,

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.220
bear the consequences.

00:10:39.259 --> 00:10:41.460
(Although Ye Dong has ulterior motives,)

00:10:41.779 --> 00:10:42.980
(for my future,)

00:10:43.419 --> 00:10:45.179
(I have to side with him now.)

00:11:45.259 --> 00:11:46.299
I can see now.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.340
I can see again.

00:11:57.139 --> 00:11:57.820
Honey.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.539
If Ye Dong finds out

00:12:07.539 --> 00:12:08.299
I can see again,

00:12:08.659 --> 00:12:09.740
he'll be overjoyed.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:11.460
Honey.

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:17.960
Only when you're dead

00:12:18.159 --> 00:12:19.080
will my son

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.600
truly claim your destiny.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.039
Once he achieves his goal,

00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:30.679
I'll send your daughter

00:12:30.679 --> 00:12:31.919
to keep you company.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.000
Don't thank me.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.919
I despise lucky people like you.

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:05.279
Honey.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.080
This is your wife's bedroom?

00:14:17.639 --> 00:14:18.600
This isn't appropriate.

00:14:21.799 --> 00:14:22.320
Relax.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.399
Makes it more exciting.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.720
She was just sleeping here.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.320
Where is she?

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:38.379
(Call the police.)

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:39.980
(Call the police now.)

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.500
Your wife is coming.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.320
She's blind.

00:16:00.639 --> 00:16:01.600
Can't see anything.
