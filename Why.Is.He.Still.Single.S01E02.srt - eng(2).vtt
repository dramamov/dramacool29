(Yu Yu Design Studio)

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.060
I'm back.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:03.670
Mr. Yu,

00:02:03.728 --> 00:02:06.030
reimburse the money
I spent on your neighbor.

00:02:06.128 --> 00:02:07.728
Didn't I already give you the gift?

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.990
Why buy her more?

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.420
You're a famous designer.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.700
Why are you so stingy?

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.420
Yeah, I felt embarrassed.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.230
I spent money and bought her something.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.510
You don't understand.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.900
It's a first prize.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.110
I gave her my good luck, okay?

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.300
All right.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.017
You always manage
to make your stinginess

00:02:24.017 --> 00:02:24.906
sound so justified.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.190
But Mr. Yu...

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.350
Your new neighbor

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.700
is actually quite cute.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.580
And her name sounds nice too.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.420
She's called...

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.550
Oh, Xia Xiaoman.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.790
When did this happen?

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.390
Let me remind you.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.550
She has a boyfriend.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.740
How do you know?

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.830
Because I heard it...

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.180
Dao.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.390
Enough.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.830
I know you adore me.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.990
Forget it.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.110
Anyway, that name something like "Dao".

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.950
It's so tacky.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.620
I see. Never mind.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.580
What do you mean "never mind"?

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.110
What do you mean?

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.390
You have a girlfriend.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.670
Wang Xiaoxiao is your girlfriend.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.510
I was joking, Ms. Lin.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.640
That's not a joke you make.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.120
Wang Xiaoxiao is my assistant.
How is that a joke?

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.990
You're not single.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.390
How can you joke about that?

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.950
What's going on in your head every day?

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.670
Tell me, what are you thinking?

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.070
Isn't this the poster from that day?

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.270
Mr. Yu, you cut it out and framed it?

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.580
You really are self-obsessed.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.540
Don't touch it.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.460
Isn't that the vomit from that day?

00:03:21.506 --> 00:03:23.195
What, is this some
new framing technique?

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.620
First, that's broth.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.550
Seafood broth.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.390
Second...

00:03:26.684 --> 00:03:28.510
I shouldn't have gone
to that party.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.020
It reminded me...

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.070
Annoying things should stay annoying.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.990
Like that sneaky Sun.

00:03:34.084 --> 00:03:35.484
I should've never cut him slack.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.390
I'm heading out first.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.230
Where to?

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.260
Seeing a "vampire."

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.790
Don't touch my work.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.300
Did I leave some work unfinished?

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
(Clinic)

00:04:05.862 --> 00:04:07.070
You haven't eaten, right?

00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:08.728
Let's go to the cafeteria. My treat.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.420
Is your butt still hurting?

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.390
After we eat,

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.300
we'll finish the rest of your treatment.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.328
I'll walk you through it.

00:04:14.328 --> 00:04:15.140
I'm not doing it.

00:04:15.195 --> 00:04:16.990
Come on,
you'll have to do it eventually.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.990
I'll take this for you. Let's go.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:20.390
Come on.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.860
A vice director this poor, seriously?

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.420
If only your sister
were as generous as you.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.300
I'm not generous.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.220
I just earn my own money
and spend my own money.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.470
Get married and you'll regret it.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.580
I already do.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.150
Are you trying to talk me
into a divorce?

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.860
Please, you're just jealous.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.590
Because no one likes you.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.590
I've tested it. Women don't dislike me.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.670
I find that hard to believe.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:48.860
Two Americanos.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.470
Thanks.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.310
See?

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.470
That female doctor at your hospital

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.420
doesn't dislike me.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.100
Dr. Gu.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.140
Yeah.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.940
Then prove it.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.950
Hello, Dad.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.300
What is this?

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.470
Why can't I see you?

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.180
Why look at me?

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.110
Look at them.

00:05:15.617 --> 00:05:17.790
- Hello, Dr. Gu.
- Hello, Miss Gu.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:18.630
Hi.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.230
What is this?

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.670
A blind date.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.550
Last chance this month.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.260
I have to make good use of it.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.470
You decide how many times a month.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.710
I decide how many people per time.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.550
Dad, come on.

00:05:31.262 --> 00:05:32.790
- Goodbye, Sir.
- Goodbye, Sir.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.900
Hello, Miss Gu.

00:05:33.951 --> 00:05:35.230
Nice to meet you on this date.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.870
Hey, Miss.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.470
What a coincidence.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.180
Have you decided to go for a check-up?

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.670
Oh, no need. I'm fine now.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:49.510
The meds worked.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.500
Sorry.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:04.910
I overheard you

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.820
talking about a blind date.

00:06:06.995 --> 00:06:08.380
Don't blame me for saying this.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:09.990
When elders force you on dates,

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.300
they claim it's for your own good,

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.350
but they're
just filling their own desires.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.060
Their lives are too empty,

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.910
nothing to do,

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.195
so they pressure you to marry.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.590
But blind dates do help older singles

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.710
speed into marriage.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.670
If you're desperate to marry,

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:25.620
it works.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.910
Last time you called me old.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.670
Now I'm an aging leftover woman?

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:29.710
Do we even know each other?

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.550
I knew you looked familiar.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.550
You're the one at the cinema

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.180
who insisted I switch seats.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.550
You just realized?

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.670
I recognized you right away.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.260
But seeing six people at once

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.670
is actually quite a clever idea.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.500
Just like advertising products,

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.550
the more people who see it,

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:49.990
the better the odds of selling.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.670
Worry about yourself.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.110
Your condition needs treatment.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.950
I'm not sick.

00:06:55.417 --> 00:06:57.620
There are only three reasons
people avoid doctors.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:58.990
One, fear of pain.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.740
Two, afraid of seeming weak.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.230
Three, ignorance of medicine.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:03.230
Which one are you?

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.790
But I tell you,

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.350
you'll be back.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.340
She's gone.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.500
Dr. Gu is the most
cultured doctor we have.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.710
Even she can't stand you.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.550
That says a lot.

00:07:20.662 --> 00:07:21.860
No more lending you money.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:22.860
Business is business!

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:32.580
Let's go.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:40.630
Sit tight.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:00.260
Bro, let's head back.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.740
I can't take this anymore.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:06.620
Nice car.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.180
Are you okay?

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:12.710
Not bad.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.230
Come on.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:26.710
How was it?

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:32.190
Is he a retired racer?

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.350
He went full off-road mode.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:35.950
I'm speechless.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.230
He's already driving so recklessly
just for a test drive...

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.500
He really doesn't care about
the test-drive car at all.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.500
Trust me,

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.900
once he buys his own car, he'll baby it.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.310
He'll buy tons of touch-up pens.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.860
More than lipstick.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.700
Exactly.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.310
But when dating, he's the opposite.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.140
Chases a girl like crazy at first,

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.380
and then stops caring once he gets her.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:59.190
You're talking about your boyfriend.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.620
You know the schedule
in the contract, right?

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.110
Why is no one on-site?

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.740
Is this how you treat clients?

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:10.790
Huh?

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.110
That shouldn't be.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.430
Sir, please don't worry.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:16.950
We'll check what happened.

The floors were already installed.

00:09:22.884 --> 00:09:24.140
Why did you tear everything up?

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.110
What's going on?

00:09:25.173 --> 00:09:27.150
That's because we're
taking responsibility for you.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.020
Taking responsibility?

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.110

Isn't this the keepsake
your boyfriend gave you?

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.884
Is he really breaking up with you?

00:09:58.262 --> 00:09:59.590
What's that supposed to mean?

00:09:59.706 --> 00:10:01.795
If you're ending it,
you should say it to my face.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.060
What kind of man does that?

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:03.900

Don't worry.

You don't need to worry
about the flooring cost or the timeline.

Tomorrow our workers

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.430
will definitely show up
at the construction site on time.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.140
If no one shows up tomorrow,
I want a refund.

No problem. You'll get it right away.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.430

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:27.990

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:37.540

Mr. Sun said Mr. Yu injured him.

00:10:41.906 --> 00:10:43.700
If Mr. Yu doesn't apologize,
he won't work.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.860
I injured him?

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:45.860
Please.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.230
So what now?

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:48.830
Find someone else.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.540
Which crew in the company
is willing to put up with you?

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.380
How about this? You go apologize to him.

00:10:55.551 --> 00:10:57.500
I didn't do anything wrong.
Why would I apologize?

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.780
Then maybe I should go apologize?

the flooring yourselves.

Oh, numb...

I did.

Perfectly straight lines.

has finally grown up.

You've been with Mr. Yu for eight years,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.540
and is this the first time

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:09.660
he has apologized?

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:14.070
What do you mean I've been
with him for eight years?

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:18.990
I mean, you two have already made it
past the seven-year itch.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.950
Maybe you should
settle things with him, Ms. Lin.

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:24.900
He might improve even faster

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.230
once he has a girlfriend.

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.860
Why should I sacrifice myself
for the good of humanity?

Besides, what does it matter to you

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:32.590
whether he grows up or not?

If Mr. Yu stops being stubborn,

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.230
he might even give me a raise.

Xiaoxiao, sit here.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:59.620

- You're welcome.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:02.860

It's fine, really.

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:06.620

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:12.550
He's not here.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.230
It's Mr. Yu's birthday today,

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.110
and it's the same day as Sun's.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:18.020
I almost forgot.

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:19.830
Let's celebrate for him then.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.660
Go order a birthday cake for Sun later.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.540
No need for Mr. Yu?

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:26.620
It's not necessary.

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:27.990
He would just say,

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.110
you're playing these silly games again.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:33.900
Childish. So childish.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:34.780
Exactly.

This... No need for much introduction.

Nice, right?

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.190
Twenty thousand. Not expensive, right?

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:49.590
No money from me,
and you're selling your stuff?

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.430
A friend opened a restaurant.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:53.310
I want to buy a share.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:55.860
Ten thousand.

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.140
You're ruthless.

00:16:58.173 --> 00:16:59.640
Half off just like that?

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.217
You were only
lending ten thousand anyway.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.660
But it's worth twenty thousand.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:03.500
Fine.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:04.780
I'll tell Yu Jie

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.500
that you stole something
from home to sell.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:08.580
What stealing?

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:10.230
It's mine to begin with.

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.190
Besides, if you had lent me money,

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:13.540
I wouldn't have sold it.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.230
Then I'll say you secretly used
your savings to buy a camera.

00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.260
Bro, that's how it is.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.390
Yu Jie may be your sister,

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.430
but I'm your brother.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.990
We grew up in the same pants, you know.

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.990
As the saying goes,

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.870
a daughter married off
is like water spilled.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:31.684
Why are you
always siding with outsiders?

00:17:31.684 --> 00:17:32.373
Eight thousand.

00:17:32.373 --> 00:17:33.070
No.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:34.420
Ten thousand.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:35.710
Ten thousand it is.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.060
But I have one condition.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:38.780
You can't sell it.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.190
I need to redeem it later.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.260
Fine.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.100
Take it yourself.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:43.660
What's the password?

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:44.750
My birthday.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:46.500
When is it?

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:47.550
Today.

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:49.710
Today?

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.100
Don't you have anything to say to me?

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:57.710
Then we need a cake to celebrate.

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:01.860
By the way,

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:04.990
look.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:12.710
Though childish,

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:14.230
it's thoughtful.

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:15.550
Fifteen hundred.

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.150
- I don't want it.
- They come as a pair.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:19.540
I hate paired items the most.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.670
Then go ahead and don't wear shoes.

00:18:21.706 --> 00:18:22.780
Remember to return my card.

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:29.860
Hey, Mom.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.950
Remember to eat noodles today.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:33.820
Wasn't I supposed to go home?

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.020
I'm on my way now.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:36.670
I'm not at home.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:37.780
Your aunt called me.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.500
She insisted I go over immediately.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:40.870
I don't even have time.

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:43.340
I'll call Yu Jie and ask her to make you

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.230
a bowl of longevity noodles.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:46.430
No need. I'll cook it myself.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.150
Don't forget to order the cake.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:49.580
Celebrate together.

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:51.300
No, just stay safe.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.140
Bye.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.551
(Birthday cake reservation,
members get 12% off)

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.417
(Birthdays mark the passage
of a person's years,)

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.928
(and tree rings mark a tree's age.)

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.100
(This is why
we want to celebrate birthdays)

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:16.780
(and why we sometimes don't.)

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.820
(With words on the cake or card,)

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:23.470
(it's just an excuse
people use to avoid awkwardness.)

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.540
(Sometimes I really find it strange.)

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.670
(Saying "Happy Birthday" in person,)

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:29.020
(is it that hard?)

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:32.150
Aren't you going to call him this year?

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:33.470
He's a teacher.

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:36.150
Do I really need to call?

00:19:36.417 --> 00:19:37.510
Just make a quick call.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.910
I'm mainly afraid he'll snap at me.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.460
(Happy birthday to me)

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:09.910
I'll make the call.

00:20:09.973 --> 00:20:12.017
I'll say "Happy Birthday"
and hang up immediately.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:12.660
Okay.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.500
(Release, send)

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:15.430
Um...

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:18.740
Mr. Yu,

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:20.390
I wish

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:21.950
you a happy birthday,

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:23.084
success in your career,

00:20:23.106 --> 00:20:25.500
and hope you
find your perfect partner soon.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.020
(Lin Sa)
(Shen Wu)

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:34.180
Hey, what's up?

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.630
Um...

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:38.340
Just say it.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.340
(Withdraw this message? Yes)

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:48.820
Mr. Sun said he'll come
to the site tomorrow.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:50.340
Got it.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:53.630
So annoying.

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:54.750
He hung up.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:55.750
He hung up?

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:00.300
(Yu Yu)

00:21:01.395 --> 00:21:02.349
Hey.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:03.500
What did you just send me?

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.884
Why did you retract the message?

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.260
I didn't send anything.

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:08.950
Just say it.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.100
Um...

00:21:14.084 --> 00:21:16.250
Finance said they need
your insurance card tomorrow.

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:17.100
Remember to bring it.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.390
Okay, I know.

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:19.990
I'll bring it. Bye.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:33.660
Who is it?

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.270
Sorry.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.020
I'm Xia Xiaoman's friend.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:37.880
Who's Xia Xiaoman?

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:39.780
Oh, the little girl next door.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:41.470
I need your help with something.

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:43.020
She's heartbroken...

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:44.030
Wait.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.217
I called her, her phone was
ringing inside, but no one answered.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.580
I'm worried something happened.

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:49.420
So?

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.230
Hello?

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:51.070
Hey.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:52.380
Hello?

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:53.780
Hey.

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:54.620
Are you okay?

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:56.580
Hello?

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.140
God...

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.260
Who are you?

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.950
Why are you here?

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.230
I didn't go to the wrong place.

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:16.060
This is my home.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:17.910
Why are you here?

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.230
I'll open it for you.

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:24.740
I mean,

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.580
you can't do this.

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:31.230
Thank you.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.390
What happened?

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.390
I'm fine, I just...

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:38.950
If you're fine, why didn't you reply?

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.870
- Alright.
- There was a creepy uncle just now

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:42.990
who just...

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:45.950
I didn't bring the keys.

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:49.910
I'll get you a glass of water.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:52.990
Dao, why didn't you watch the door?

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:55.020
You're being naughty.

00:24:00.484 --> 00:24:02.390
Alright, I'll leave
the water here for you.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.780
Dao, move aside.

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.100
Okay.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.990
How did that creepy man
get onto my balcony?

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:16.950
It's fine. Just lie down here for a bit.

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:17.910
Just rest for a while.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.950
Do you need my help?

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:22.790
No, I'm fine.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:25.020
Be careful then.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:25.860
Goodbye.

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:31.820
Dao.

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:35.060
Alright, I'll go get you
some hangover medicine.

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:35.950
Lie down for a bit.

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:44.870
Why are you treating me like this?

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:40.500
What now?

00:25:40.751 --> 00:25:42.020
She seems to have fainted again.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:43.420
What's the password?

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:45.580
I don't know.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:47.310
Ah?

00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:59.990
Hello, you can come in now.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:05.660
Dr. Gu.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.260
Where is the patient's girlfriend?

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:19.630
She was outside
when I last checked, but...

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.990
I was about to leave.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.740
Her bestie insisted I stay
and keep her company.

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.780
She said she'll be busy tomorrow.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:27.030
It's so annoying.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:28.470
You can explain.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.100
Okay.

00:26:32.106 --> 00:26:34.340
Dr. Gu has already performed
gastric lavage on your neighbor.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.595
Her condition is stable for now.

00:26:35.617 --> 00:26:36.990
However, she may vomit again,

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:38.310
so be careful to prevent choking.

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:39.210
Okay.

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:40.070
If anything happens,

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.630
press the red button by the bedside.

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:42.990
We'll come immediately.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:44.790
Okay.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:26:59.900
Hello.

00:27:00.484 --> 00:27:01.870
Please deliver a cake for me.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:13.780

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:23.351
Someone's having a birthday?

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:24.900
No.

00:28:26.684 --> 00:28:28.020
This cake shop is really good.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:29.830
Try it.

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:35.620
Thank you.

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:40.470
I'm sorry about that blind date

00:28:41.617 --> 00:28:42.906
at the cafeteria that day.

00:28:45.217 --> 00:28:46.540
I didn't mean to offend you.

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:48.430
I just used the wrong example.

00:28:48.973 --> 00:28:51.240
I shouldn't have compared you
to a commodity.

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:53.820
After all, you are a living person.

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:54.660
Right?

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.020
Treating humans as commodities

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:58.300
belongs to the era of slavery.

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:00.510
What?

00:29:01.928 --> 00:29:03.390
Did I say something wrong again?

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.500
What do you think?

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:08.750
Anyway,

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.230
I'm sorry.

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:28.860
(Happy)

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:36.870
Happy.

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.260
Sir, are you okay?

00:30:05.284 --> 00:30:06.430
- What's wrong?
- It hurts.

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:07.860
- Sir.
- It hurts.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:18.300
Show me the previous case.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.660
(Main: Acute abdominal pain,
sweating, dizziness, fainting)

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.660
(Emergency department medical record)

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.180
(Attending doctor: Gu Yejia)

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:34.020
Prepare for a rectal exam.

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:40.780
No rectal exam.

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:42.390
This exam is necessary.

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:43.990
Then have Zhong Liangchuan come.

00:30:44.062 --> 00:30:46.240
The vice president asked me
to do this exam for you.

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:47.140
Ah?

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:09.630
Can we

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:12.580
use the same medication as last time?

00:31:12.595 --> 00:31:14.573
Because you didn't
follow instructions last time,

00:31:14.573 --> 00:31:16.340
your relapse is worse this time.

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:26.710
Happy Birthday.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:35.900
Relax.

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:36.990
Okay.

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:49.300
Xia Xiaoman, you're awake.

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:50.500
How do you feel?

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:53.500
What happened?

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.870
You drank too much.

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:55.951
We performed gastric lavage.

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.540
But don't worry, you're fine now.

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.300
My head hurts so much.

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:04.870
But, thank you, Dr. Gu.

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:06.990
Qing brought me here, right?

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:08.540
- Yes.
- Where is she?

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:09.470
She left first.

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:10.390
It's your neighbor,

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:11.580
Yu Yu, staying with you.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:13.270
Yu...

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.830
Where is he?

00:32:15.284 --> 00:32:16.795
He didn't follow the doctor's advice.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.390
Then his old condition flared up.

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:19.870
So you need to listen to me.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:21.820
Drink less in the future.

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:24.630
I usually don't drink this much.

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:28.470
I just went through a breakup.

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.300
There are many ways
to deal with heartbreak.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.060
You don't have to
harm your body to cope.

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:37.950
For example?

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:43.020
- Ah!
- Ah!

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.260
How do you feel now?

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:47.340
Much better.

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.540
See, this method never fails.

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:51.820
Also, remember,

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.230
you didn't do anything wrong.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:54.870
All the fault is his.

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:56.390
As the saying goes,

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:57.870
grow through heartbreak.

00:32:58.662 --> 00:33:00.870
Next time, I'll be
more careful choosing a boyfriend.

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:03.190
Thank you, Dr. Gu,
for taking care of me all night

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:04.190
and staying with me here.

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:06.470
No problem, we live so close.
It was on the way.

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.260
I didn't expect we lived so near.

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:10.500
Just one street apart.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.340
Yeah.

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.230
From now on,
you can come over for meals anytime.

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:15.390
I cook really well.

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.470
Let me tell you my specialties.

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:18.710
Braised pork ribs,

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:19.950
Yangzhou fried rice,

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:20.950
curry crab,

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:22.820
and desserts,

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:23.990
like various sago puddings.

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.990
I make them really well.

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.990
But while food can heal everything,

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:30.870
it can also make you gain weight.

00:33:31.862 --> 00:33:33.820
Sometimes we can also
go watch a movie together.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:35.260
That sounds great.

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.340
I just moved here,

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:39.630
and my best friend,
Qing, lives far away.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:41.300
I feel a bit lonely alone.

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:45.230
From now on,
I'll hang out with you more often.

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:46.070
No problem.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:55.150
Shall we go watch a movie later?

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:56.870
Next time.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:58.100
I just finished a night shift.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:33:59.580
I need a proper beauty sleep.

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.990
To restore all my lost energy.

You two
haven't had breakfast yet, right?

00:35:47.017 --> 00:35:48.862
- Good morning, Dr. Gu.
- Good morning, Dr. Gu.

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:49.900
Here.

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:51.310
What is this?

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:55.540
This is a trending breakfast.

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:57.390
- Thanks, Jia.
- You're welcome.

00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:58.830
It's really hard to get.

00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:00.060
You didn't sleep well either.

00:36:00.684 --> 00:36:03.230
Woke up in the middle of the night.
Then couldn't fall back asleep.

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:04.350
Let's go to work.

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:05.190
Okay.

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.990
You chat, and we'll work.

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.830
Okay.

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:13.500
Feeling better?

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:17.540
Half an hour before your shift.

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:18.630
Great.

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:19.830
My personal matters

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:21.328
won't interfere with medical resources.

00:36:21.328 --> 00:36:22.217
Personal matters?

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:23.670
For you.

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:26.430
What's this?

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:28.310
This is sealing wax.

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:29.380
Also called beeswax.

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.750
Made from pine resin, lime, and...

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:33.430
I mean, what's inside it?

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.580
(From Yu Yu)

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.284
(Presented to Dr. Gu Yejia)
Though talkative,

00:36:44.284 --> 00:36:45.470
medical skills are solid.

00:36:46.528 --> 00:36:48.140
Let's not talk about "though talkative,"

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.906
what does "medical skills
are solid" mean?

00:36:49.973 --> 00:36:52.390
I was referencing Bian Que,
Hua Tuo, and Li Shizhen.

00:36:52.862 --> 00:36:54.430
Then why are you giving me a banner?

00:36:56.906 --> 00:36:58.430
Because you were the only person

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:00.620
to wish me well on my birthday.

00:37:00.662 --> 00:37:02.106
Even though I didn't need it.

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:11.350
So it's to thank me said

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:12.310
happy birthday to you?

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:13.990
I'm not thanking you.

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:15.500
I just acknowledge you.

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:18.910
Then I must thank you
for your recognition.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:20.620
I'm off to work.

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:23.310
Oh, right.

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:27.270
Zhong Liangchuan
said my test results are ready

00:37:27.284 --> 00:37:28.750
and asked me to have you review them.

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:30.270
Then go get the report.

00:37:30.551 --> 00:37:32.430
Once you have it,
wait for me in my clinic.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:33.940
Okay.

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.780
(Emergency Evacuation Map)

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:45.420
The form.

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:50.060
Why did you
also take the pathology slides?

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:52.500
These polyps

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.700
are no longer my concern.

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:55.270
I am no longer their host.

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:58.180
If you want to keep them as specimens,

00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.580
(Zhongjing Private Hospital)
you can keep them.

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:01.580
Why would I want the trash
from your intestines?

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:02.620
Keep it yourself.

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:05.700
Polyps are also called tumors.

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:08.500
Tumors?

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:10.620
Malignant ones

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.060
are called cancer.

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:13.230
Right.

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:19.350
What are you thinking?

00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:20.830
I... I'm thinking of my last words,

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.100
but I can't come up with anything yet.

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:26.470
Yours are benign.

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:33.470
But you do have some other issues.

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:34.990
What issues?

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:36.100
(Test Report)

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:37.660
High cholesterol.

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.020
Blood pressure and sugar
are at risky levels.

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:41.140
So it's the three highs?

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.020
Nothing serious.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:43.470
In your case,

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:44.750
if you eat more vegetables,

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:46.220
fiber, and quality protein,

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:47.870
it shouldn't be a big problem.

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:51.100
But you need to eat
fewer fatty and oily foods.

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:53.950
Keep your diet low-fat,
low-salt, and low-sugar.

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:56.270
Then what's the point of life?

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:58.580
Is your life's meaning
just eating fatty meat?

00:38:58.750 --> 00:38:59.950
Eat a few more pieces,

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:01.470
shorten your life, and it's meaningful?

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:03.020
My life, my choice.

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:03.990
That's all I have to say.

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.910
Take care of yourself.

00:39:05.484 --> 00:39:07.040
Don't forget the words on the banner

00:39:07.062 --> 00:39:07.790
I gave you.

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:08.790
I'll see you later.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:15.540
Take this.

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:19.990
Hello, Sir. We're celebrating
the opening of our new store.

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:21.020
We have special set deals.

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.020
Would you like to come in and try some?

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:25.340
Sure.

00:39:26.617 --> 00:39:27.900
Sir, how many in your party?

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:29.740
(Ou Yang, Chief Contracted Designer)

00:39:33.062 --> 00:39:34.484
Are there any other seats available?

00:39:34.684 --> 00:39:36.460
- Do you know what this is?
- None for now.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.180
Spinach?

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:39.373
- Not quite.
- Over here.

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:41.020
I just got these today from...

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:42.870
Here's our menu.
You can take a look first.

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:44.430
Air-flown round leaf spinach.

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:46.270
Compared to all spinach on the market,

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.100
it has less water content.

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:49.430
Coarser fiber.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.580
The key point is,

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:52.390
it's high in oxalates.

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:54.020
Very nutritious.

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.990
As the famous food blogger,

00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:58.700
Zhang Yingqiu said.

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:01.950
Who's Zhang Yingqiu?

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:02.950
I know her.

00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:04.190
Celery.

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:05.270
Did you know?

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.830
Last Thursday,

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:08.870
I suddenly wanted Italian parsley.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:10.790
So I flew to Greece.

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:14.270
There, I experienced
Greek stuffed vegetables.

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:15.620
You really have taste.

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:18.140
So today, we continue the experience.

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.017
Even though we don't have
Mediterranean sunshine here,

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.870
- Sir,
- we can still enjoy

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:23.750
a fiber-rich roasted meal.

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:26.573
(Project Designer Yu Yu)

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:27.700
Could you explain this?

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:33.140
You see, in Mr. Yu's mind,

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:36.020
the most important parts
of a home are the kitchen

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:37.220
and the bedroom.

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:40.100
So he chose very high-quality wood

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:42.020
for the kitchen utensils

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:43.100
and the bedroom furniture.

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:44.380
Therefore?

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:47.220
This premium wood
is currently out of stock,

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:48.660
so it must be ordered from abroad.

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:50.140
Hence, the cost increased.

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:52.230
I disagree.

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:53.990
Honestly,

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:56.870
I plan to rent out this apartment.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.470
So I can't possibly spend
that much on renovation.

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:01.350
Renting?

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:04.020
The tenants also deserve comfort.

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:06.100
So I'd be paying

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:08.470
for a stranger's happiness?

00:41:09.706 --> 00:41:10.870
You could put it that way.

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:14.350
Why? What do I gain?

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:15.660
Raise the rent?

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:17.830
This is already a high-end rental.

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:19.580
If I raise the rent further,

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:21.310
I won't be able to rent the place out.

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:23.910
But you'll gain a sense of achievement
and gratitude from others.

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:24.560
Isn't that enough?

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:25.510
Just for a "thank you"?

00:41:25.795 --> 00:41:27.430
I'd have to spend
tens of thousands more.

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:28.430
I thank you in advance.

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:30.350
But right now, we...

00:41:30.351 --> 00:41:31.551
Let's not do "but" for now.

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:34.100
If you keep saying "but,"

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.870
I'll hire another designer.

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:38.580
I think your company's

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:41.390
Ou Yang's design is really quite good.

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:42.790
Hey, do you know?

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:44.580
Last Thursday I wanted curry...

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:46.390
So I flew to Greece.

00:41:46.417 --> 00:41:47.595
Greek stuffed vegetables.

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:53.220
Not bad?

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:54.980
Take a look.

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:08.706
(European Modern Minimalist)

00:42:08.706 --> 00:42:10.380
(European Retro meets Modern Minimalist)

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:13.620
You just want to say it's copied, right?

00:42:13.662 --> 00:42:15.417
Whether it's copied or not,
I don't care.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:16.700
As long as it looks good.

00:42:16.751 --> 00:42:18.620
Are you saying my design
doesn't look good?

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.870
Then do you think it looks good?

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:23.950
I think it looks good.

00:42:24.973 --> 00:42:26.395
Sir, what do you think about this?

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:28.100
Can you give us two more days?

00:42:28.306 --> 00:42:30.910
Then we can come up with a solution
that satisfies both sides.

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:31.940
Two days?

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:35.430
Just two days for you.

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:36.670
No problem.

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:40.140
Thank you for your trust.

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:43.060
Are you out of your mind?
