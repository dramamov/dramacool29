=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.980
=Episode 21=

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.580
Shen.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.100
I have been thinking.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.000
Mr. Hu

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.770
takes time every noon to tutor Minghui.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.700
Should we show our appreciation?

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.690
- Right.
- I already brought him chops, Mom.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.820
Chops hardly count.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.660
That is nothing.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.250
- I am back.
- We still need to thank him properly.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.860
Mingzhu, I will dish your rice.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.460
Alright.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.450
You must be hungry.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.700
Come on, eat first.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.380
You finished all the soup and meat.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.900
Yu Jingxiang said thank you.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.950
She does not need to thank me.
I should thank her.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.860
Tell her not to stir things up again.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.540
She nearly made us doubt ourselves.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.050
Your mom is always like this.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.820
She does a good deed.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.620
But she never softens her words.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.550
She is not easy to please.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.550
I know I am not easy to please.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.860
If you want someone pleasant,
find someone else.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.460
Look at you.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.460
Zhixia.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.860
Let me tell you.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.460
Today Hu Gang

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.320
went on and on at me.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.860
When I mentioned Feng Meiqi,

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.460
he went quiet straight away.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.580
He looked heartbroken.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.500
Do you have any sense?

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.840
Why would you bring up Feng Meiqi?

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.100
I had no choice.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.140
If I do not break his defense,

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.500
he keeps lecturing me.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.980
You...

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.900
Honestly, child.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.900
He treats you so well.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.500
Should you not show some gratitude?

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.110
You do not know what is good for you.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.900
You have no sense of appreciation.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.930
Do not speak of it again.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.740
Zhu.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.700
At your hotel,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.630
you have those staff meal vouchers.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.140
Or the meal cards, right?

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.510
Shall we buy a few for Mr. Hu?

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.530
But Hu Gang is single.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.810
Who would he invite with a meal card?

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.060
His future father-in-law.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.340
Ni Debao.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:04.730
Ni Debao?

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.860
Ni Debao.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.340
Ni Debao

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.740
has already helped Miss Ni

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.330
get Mr. Hu's WeChat.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.100
Why is Ni Debao so unreliable?

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.840
We definitely cannot buy that card.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.300
He will end up using it on Ni Debao.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.340
And who knows

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.740
which woman he will take with it.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.120
Stop spending time with Ni Debao.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.080
You will only pick up the bad parts.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.780
How about

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.900
we simply give him a red envelope?

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:30.640
What do you think?

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.500
A red envelope works.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.820
Alright, I will go get some cash.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.740
A red envelope then.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.540
Are you thanking Mr. Hu

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.100
or dragging him into trouble?

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.060
That...

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.380
Then how should we thank him?

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.340
You

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.140
should give him a special gift.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.460
Something useful at home or away.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.650
Something he can use for life.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.340
What kind of gift?

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:55.620
Me.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.030
Mr. Hu Gang, is that you?

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.710
Yes, I am.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.580
Hello.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.620
Thank you
for looking after our Shen Minghui.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.260
Enjoy something nice to eat.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.660
Here you go.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.020
Thank you.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.740
See you tomorrow.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:09.820
How does it feel?

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.740
Apart from the clothes,

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.820
you do not look anything
like Feng Meiqi.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:14.580
You know nothing.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.860
Hello, Mr. Hu.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.420
My name is Ni.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.140
That is far too forced.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.130
Mr. Hu

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.020
has already been hurt once.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.500
Can you not try a different style?

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.540
Let me tell you.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.900
Men always fall into the same trap

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.180
again and again.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.390
Just look at my dad.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.460
Mom, come in.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.900
What are you doing?

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.180
- Come on.
- Mom is working.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.900
Look.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.900
You are pregnant?

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.830
Did I not tell you

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.540
that you cannot have a child now?

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:57.860
It just happened.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.730
We are getting married anyway.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.920
Does Xu Zhidong know?

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.740
I have not had the chance to tell him.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:06.940
I will tell him now.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.900
You cannot tell him yet.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.200
We need to visit his mom
at the hospital first.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.700
See what their attitude is.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.980
Why?

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.020
Why what?

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.460
When you are not pregnant,
you have many options.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.420
When you are pregnant,
you have none. Understand?

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.820
If they find out you are pregnant now,

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.210
you have to marry Xu Zhidong.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.640
There will be no choice. Understand?

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.260
You have no sense at all.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:50.540
Mom.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.070
Zhidong.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.020
How are you today?

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.380
Do you feel better?

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.380
Much better.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.660
Good.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.580
Xu went to the reservoir
early this morning caught a fish

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.770
and cooked it into soup for you.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.660
Not bad.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.020
Want some?

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.340
No.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.320
No.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.420
If your useless dad really cared
about me that much, would I...

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.750
Would I have ended up
needing a blood transfusion?

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.660
Again.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.340
Auntie.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.020
Chen, Auntie.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.410
Bichen.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:22.580
Zhidong.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:22.900
Give it to me.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.900
- Yu.
- Mrs. Yuan.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:24.620
You are here.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.200
Zhidong.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.330
- Help me sit up.
- How is he now?

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.110
Feeling any better?

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:28.740
I feel much better.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.740
No need to sit up.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.980
- Auntie.
- No need to get up, just lie down.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.980
You are really too polite.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.420
- Slowly.
- I have to get up.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.260
Slow down.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:35.900
I really have to sit up.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.780
How about this?

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.500
You are being far too polite.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.550
Polite about what?

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.250
- What are you saying?
- You came all this way to see me.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.580
Bichen.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:44.650
Auntie.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.040
Good girl.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.340
I have been stuck here
in bed since I got sick.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.700
Your wedding has been delayed
because of me.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.080
You do not blame me, do you?

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.980
Auntie, of course not.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.170
Please do not say that.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:57.510
Exactly. Not at all.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.790
Do not stand, have a seat.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:00.420
Alright.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:01.620
Are you lying comfortably?

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:08.140
I had a real brush with death this time.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.260
I have missed you.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:10.740
Yu.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.420
Please do not say that.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.830
A wedding is something
for both families.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.820
I should contribute as well.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:18.900
Right.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.220
Look.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.180
I asked someone to pick a date.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.060
Here.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.700
The 26th of this month

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.320
is an especially good day for a wedding.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.550
A really auspicious date.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.380
So I think

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.340
we should simply hold the wedding

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.660
for both children on that day.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.140
The 26th of this month.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.620
A good day.

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.340
Alright.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.260
Yes, it is a good date.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.420
But I am... You see I am...

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.420
I still here in hospital.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.090
I have not prepared anything at all.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:52.900
Is it too rushed?

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.620
Yu.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.540
I understand, I really do.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.500
But as people say,
when a man grows up he should marry,

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:00.460
and a woman should wed.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.500
Both children are no longer young.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.420
Even Bichen's classmate's child
is already in kindergarten.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:07.150
Yes.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.450
As parents,

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.730
we should hurry
and get their wedding done.

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.740
Then our duty is complete, right?

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.290
Yes.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.350
We can keep the wedding simple.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.050
Just follow what we agreed before.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.250
A dowry of 200,000 yuan,

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.820
and a small flat will do.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.580
Auntie, do not worry.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.740
My mom already agreed earlier.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.730
Yes, it is all settled.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.380
Everything is settled.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:32.100
Well.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:33.920
Zhidong.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.540
Your dad made this soup for me.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:36.880
I should drink it while it is hot.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:37.780
Otherwise it will go cold.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.070
Auntie, I will serve it for you.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:47.930
What happened?

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:49.330
- Bichen.
- Chen.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:50.090
What is wrong?

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:50.770
Chen.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:51.980
I am fine.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.900
She probably kicked off the quilt
at night and caught a chill.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.100
The weather...

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.660
She needs to keep warm.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.260
Bichen.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.460
Are are you feeling any better?

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.460
I am fine, Auntie.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:09.720
She's fine, Yu.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.710
In that case,

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.820
take your time and rest.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.030
I will take Bichen home first.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.180
Auntie, we will head off then.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:17.700
Off you go.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.420
Mom, I will walk them out.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.340
Alright, alright.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.110
When I am discharged,

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.460
come over to the house
and sit for a bit.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.020
Still feeling unwell?

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.500
A bit better.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.020
You threw up all your breakfast.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.500
I will buy you a hot milk tea.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:46.590
No.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.300
It is not healthy.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.500
The milk tea princess
says milk tea is not healthy.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.900
Are you pregnant?

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:55.340
Get lost.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.110
I was joking.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:58.020
Zhidong.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.340
No need to walk us out.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.420
Let us go.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:01.940
I am leaving.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.140
Go back inside.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.700
Goodbye, Auntie.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.210
They have gone.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:14.780
Chen,

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.900
send me a WeChat message
when you reach home.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.500
How is Bichen's health usually?

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:24.540
Better than mine.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.220
She has been eating and drinking

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:32.620
normally these days, right?

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.940
Mom, do not worry.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:34.980
She said just now

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.460
that her stomach felt uncomfortable.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.840
I offered to buy her milk tea
but she refused.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.220
Good lad, my son.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:48.980
Mom.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.300
What are you thinking about?

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.180
I mean, Chen and I

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.580
are usually very careful.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.660
Ni.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.660
Why are you here?

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.260
Get lost.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.460
Why are you dressed like this?

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.420
Do whatever you like somewhere else.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.740
I have not caused trouble lately.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:44.860
Mr. Hu.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.460
Have something nice to eat.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:49.260
You...

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.060
Take it.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.290
You coming here every day,
it does not affect your work?

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.260
See you tomorrow.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.100
Then the lunch box from yesterday...

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:39.700
(Nanzhou Dianlan Group
Mid-level Post Competition Meeting)

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.940
Next candidate, Zhang Hao.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.260
Hello, everyone.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.120
I am Zhang Hao
from the Administration Office.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.180
I am Zhang Hao
from the Administration Office.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.300
The position I am applying for is

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.390
Head of Human Resources.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.740
Since joining
Dianlan Group 12 years ago,

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.820
I have always worked in administration

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.620
and human resources.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.350
For the annual campus recruitment

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.170
and major recruitment fairs
in the industry,

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:19.680
I have always been the lead organizer.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.260
This feels wonderful.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:26.900
Yu.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.700
Daughters really are the best.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.500
Yes.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.170
A daughter looks after you properly.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.100
That is why I am about to be discharged.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:35.990
That is rare.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:37.860
You are actually praising me.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.260
Gently, you.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:43.980
What is it?

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.220
If I want to praise you,
do I have to say it out loud?

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.380
Where else would I put it then?

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:53.700
In a red envelope.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:54.580
Come on, give me your phone.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:55.340
Send me a red envelope.

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.260
You cheeky girl.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.260
Stop messing about.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:58.860
You are always fooling around here.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.860
I have something serious to tell you.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.260
You change the subject
as soon as I mention red envelopes.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.810
Alright, tell me the serious thing.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:17.520
It is about Bichen.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.580
She might be pregnant.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.260
Are you serious?

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:24.740
Yes.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:28.810
Your brother

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.260
really is something.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:36.060
Mom.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.260
Is this really something to praise?

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.220
Why are you pulling such a long face?

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.260
There is no one else here,
just the two of us.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.900
We can talk properly.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:47.750
If she is pregnant,

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:48.700
then the wedding

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:49.820
needs to be arranged soon.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.740
You should quickly
take that 200,000 yuan

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.180
to Bichen's family.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:54.940
And

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.260
for the banquet and the wedding company,

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.500
ask Mingzhu to handle it.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.660
No, wait.

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:01.660
No, this is not urgent.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.060
For her to start showing,

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.660
it will still take some time.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.220
I was thinking,

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:11.700
well,

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.250
about Bichen.

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.760
She is already pregnant now.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:17.940
So I was thinking,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.940
what is done is done,

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.160
and about the bride price...

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.420
Are you out of your mind?

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.500
You gave me a fright.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.060
What are you thinking?

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:25.820
Where did you even get such an idea?

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:26.340
No...

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.980
That baby in her belly
is your own grandchild.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:28.700
I know that.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.370
If she marries
into this family and finds out,

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:31.660
how will she see you and our family?

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:32.370
But...

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:33.840
You have already failed one daughter.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.820
You cannot fail
another family's daughter as well.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:36.620
I did not.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.740
Listen to me, Mom.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.800
If Jiao's future in-laws
ever dare to do this to her,

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.810
I will be the first to fight them.

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:41.750
I would tear them apart.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.620
(20 percent off after 8:00 PM)

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.060
(First-round shortlisted candidates
of Lilan Group, Zhang Hao, overall score 9.5)

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.820
Hello, I would like to pay.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:58.180
Sir.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.260
The discount only starts after 8:00 PM.

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.700
I will just pay the full price.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.780
Charge me whatever it is.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:04.980
Alright.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.340
I will scan your code.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.180
(First-round shortlisted candidates)
Here.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.820
Sir, this is not your payment code.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:13.950
I tapped the wrong one.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:15.020
Here.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:17.700
Jiao.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:22.980
A doughnut.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.500
Chocolate flavour.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.660
Today you did not
buy the discounted ones.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.660
Today I paid full price.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.600
Zhang, you are being generous today.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.060
Spicy sticks.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:34.880
Spicy sticks?

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.020
Crisps.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:36.970
Crisps?

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:40.180
And your favourite milk toffee.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.300
But these are all junk food.

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:46.180
Mom will not allow it.

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:47.800
Mom does not allow you to eat them.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:49.400
Dad allows it. Eat.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:51.960
What is wrong with you today?

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.020
I am standing up for once.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:53.980
What is going on?

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.300
- Is everything really fine?
- Today my mom

00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.700
- nearly made me explode.
- Eat.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.900
You have no idea what that woman
has been up to.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.220
Jiao, how many times have I told you?

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.180
You cannot eat these, do you understand?

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.500
They are all junk food.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:12.300
You are still young.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.570
My dad bought them for me.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.500
He forced them into my hands.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:17.960
Zhang Hao.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.420
How many times have I told you?

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.490
Children cannot eat this kind of junk.

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:22.300
(First-round shortlisted candidates
of Lilan Group, Zhang Hao)

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.140
What is this?

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:28.950
You made the shortlist?

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.500
No gifts.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:31.860
No treating anyone.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:33.620
And I still reached the final round.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.940
So I would like to invite Miss Jiao

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.060
to share a spicy stick.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.260
Do you think that is too much?

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:43.020
Not at all.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.260
My left hand feels empty.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.260
Director Zhang.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.020
My right hand feels empty too.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.620
Dad.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.940
It feels great to have someone
on each side.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:19:59.460
I am hungry.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.900
Director Zhang, have you cooked?

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.260
Cook what?

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.380
We will eat out.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:06.060
Go cook.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:06.660
Alright.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:08.820
I actually bought the groceries already.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:11.780
Jiao.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.340
Your dad is about to become a director.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.220
Look what my dad bought me.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.180
A chocolate doughnut.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.340
So fancy.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:26.980
Minghui, come here.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:29.020
Sit.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.100
What do you want?

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:35.740
Sugarcane.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:37.780
You are being generous.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.260
What do you want?

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.060
Has Mr. Hu been acting strange

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:46.780
at school recently?

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:48.780
Mr. Hu?

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:50.740
Yes.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:52.380
Every time class ends,

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.900
he does this, this, and this.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.660
He is over the moon every day.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:20:59.700
Alright, got it.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:02.900
Do me a favour and work harder lately.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.180
Study properly.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.820
Otherwise I will lose face
going to school.

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:07.620
Ni.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.860
Does my exam result

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.020
have anything to do with you?

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.450
- Do not do that.
- You brat.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:16.420
What should my dad cook tomorrow?

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:18.740
Make spicy chicken.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.460
Mr. Hu does not eat spicy food.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:21.900
I do.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:23.380
The sugarcane is yours.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.020
Hope it burns your mouth.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:30.740
Thank you, Ni.

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:31.980
You are welcome.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:36.720
The braised chops are here.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:37.560
Alright, thank you.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.570
Enjoy slowly.

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:39.100
Thank you.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.540
Who ordered the spicy chicken?

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.100
Mr. Hu Gang ordered it.

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.180
Mr. Hu Gang ordered for himself?

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.490
You added too many chillies.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.640
He must think of us as his own.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:07.290
The heat...

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:08.500
Is the heat too high?

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:18.900
This tastes great.

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.100
You did not deliver
that love packed meal to him?

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.260
Love should not be overused.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:29.860
Once anything becomes excessive,

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:30.680
it becomes a problem.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:31.840
What are you here for?

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:33.800
There is a case.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.560
I want to discuss
its feasibility with you.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:38.300
What is it? Tell me.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.900
The bride and groom have a request.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:41.680
It is a bit...

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:42.740
A bit what?

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:45.700
A bit unusual.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:46.940
How unusual?

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.780
The groom's surname is Niu.
The bride is an Ox in the zodiac.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.660
They met during a company event
when they were feeding cows.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:52.380
So...

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:53.220
So?

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:55.900
They would like a cow
as a special guest.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:01.860
And this cow

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.340
needs to perform?

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:04.180
No.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:05.660
It only needs to stand there.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:06.860
But it cannot move

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.540
and it cannot poop.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.660
That is easy. I can handle it.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.140
Do not agree so quickly.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.780
Think about
whether it is possible first.

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:15.660
I signed the contract.
I have a responsibility.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:16.900
Mingzhu.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.340
Has pregnancy made you slow?

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.200
That cattle farmer in the suburbs

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.620
is Ni Debao's old mate.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.260
Getting a cow
to attend their banquet is easy.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:26.260
No.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.940
The cow needs to stand still.

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:29.700
I know, it cannot poop.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.300
Right.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:31.580
Do not worry.

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:32.980
You focus on signing the deal
and taking the deposit.

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.140
I will handle the rest.

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:37.700
Mingzhu.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.010
Your dad's spicy chicken tastes great.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.430
My dad thought he made it for Mr. Hu.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:44.620
Got excited for nothing.

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:45.940
Just wait until I win Mr. Hu over.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.620
Ordering food will be
the same as him ordering.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.340
No difference.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:51.360
Do not brag too soon.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:52.500
Do not forget

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.020
you are still dressed like Feng Meiqi.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:55.900
What does that mean?

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:57.200
It means in his heart,

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.740
he has not let go of Feng Meiqi.

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:00.780
Soon.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:01.860
Very soon.

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:03.660
Is it working?

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:08.480
It's over.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.620
You have really dragged me into trouble.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.990
A person holding roses needs no gods.

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:20.780
Mr. Hu.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:28.140
Show me your homework.

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:41.980
Shen Minghui.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.860
Do you have another sister?

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.020
Who?

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:49.280
Ni?

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.130
Her surname is Ni.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:53.980
Why is yours Shen?

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:55.620
She is not my real sister.

00:24:58.460 --> 00:24:59.420
Is she alright?

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:00.460
What happened?

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.060
Nothing.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:06.420
Mr. Hu.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:08.220
Do you like her?

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.020
Children should not pry.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:14.940
You got this one wrong again.

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.420
I explained it to you yesterday.

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:17.140
Do it again.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:22.580
(Ni)

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.500
If you call out to me,

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.780
I will turn around.

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:33.780
What are you staring at?

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.100
Get on with your work.

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:52.420
I do not understand.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.820
You run a wedding business.

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:55.340
Why do you need to borrow a cow?

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:57.370
Competition is tough now.

00:25:57.370 --> 00:25:59.110
Whatever the client wants, we deliver.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.060
Even if they want a demon king,

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:01.140
I have to get it.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:05.780
The cow itself is not hard to sort out.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:07.380
But...

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:08.370
Stop beating around the bush.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.300
You want money?

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:11.950
If you want money, you get money.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.180
Say it earlier.

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:14.360
Say it earlier that I will get money.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.290
I will sort this out

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:16.300
properly for you.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.220
Your face looks pale.

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:21.750
Are you unwell?

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.500
So you can tell I am ill.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:25.460
Then that's right.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.610
Class, be mindful of the time.

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.700
For big questions,
think for at most five minutes.

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:37.460
If you cannot solve it, move on.

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:05.180
(WeChat. Ni)

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.580
(Ni: Hello Mr. Hu,
I am Shen Minghui's sister)

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.780
(Hello)

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:33.260
Three, two, one.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:35.780
Mr. Hu.

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:38.540
What is wrong?

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:39.980
Are you feeling unwell?

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.620
I had a cold a few days ago.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:42.860
I still have a bit of a cough.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.580
I came just to say hello.

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.300
I did not bring you food these days.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.700
You did not starve, did you?

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:48.280
No.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.780
The canteen is convenient enough for me.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:52.900
Minghui's sister...

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:53.780
My name is Ni.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:56.420
Ni.

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:58.860
You do not look well.

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.380
Shall I buy you some chicken soup

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:01.340
to help you recover?

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.140
If you are busy...

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:03.930
I am free.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.870
Alright, I will head upstairs then.

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:08.300
Okay.

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:11.910
Wait for me.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:14.740
Please wait for me.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:28.700
This way please.

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:36.460
Please have a seat.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:42.630
Excuse me.

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:43.780
We would like to order.

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.900
I am sorry.
Our dishes are displayed openly.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.150
You need to select them in the kitchen.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:48.060
Then...

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:49.300
Then let us go together.

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:50.580
No need. You choose.

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:52.200
I have brought you food for days.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.560
I know we like the same flavours.

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:55.340
Alright.

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.820
I will get one chicken soup

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.180
and one meat dish
and one vegetable. Enough?

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:00.920
More than enough.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:02.700
Okay.

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:03.340
Show me the way.

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:03.900
This way.

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:15.820
Hello, what is it?

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.260
I just want to ask you.

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:18.500
Is the cow sorted out?

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.720
Do not worry. It is sorted.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:21.380
Let me tell you.

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:22.790
Not only the cow is sorted.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.420
Hu Gang is almost sorted too.

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:26.300
What did you do?

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:29.460
I am just showing him concern.

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:31.440
I told him I have not
brought him food for days.

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.500
I was afraid he might go hungry.

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.460
Before he met you,
he never ate properly anyway.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:38.530
Hello.

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:39.180
Yes.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.230
Move in.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:41.150
Yes.

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:41.580
Here.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.300
Mr. Hu, yes?

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:42.940
Your takeaway.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.180
Thank you.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:48.660
Exactly.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:49.740
I barely eaten.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.220
Luckily my friend felt sorry for me

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:53.700
and brought me for chicken soup.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.290
I will talk to you later.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:29:59.950
I have finished ordering the dishes.

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.940
I just heard you coughing again,

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.720
so I bought you some medicine.

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:09.690
Good food with good medicine

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.740
helps you recover faster.

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:13.900
Mr. Hu.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:15.230
You are very thoughtful.

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:19.660
You can take it after the meal.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:29.300
Hello, Miss Zhang.

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.660
I checked with the wedding planners.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.060
The cow is arranged.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.820
This chicken soup is rich in protein.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.170
It can boost your immunity.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.810
It works very well against a cold.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.170
You will get better quickly
after drinking it.

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:45.420
Mr. Hu.

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:46.920
How do you know all this?

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:48.980
Not really.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:50.620
Careful, it is hot.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.340
Thank you, you are very kind.

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:54.780
Not really.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:01.140
Water celery with tofu.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:02.180
Thank you.

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:05.540
How about some warm yellow rice wine
for you two?

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:06.360
It warms the stomach.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.100
I do not drink.

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:09.020
She has a cold.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.060
She cannot drink either.

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.380
I want a little.

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.100
Warm it with some ginger.

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:14.070
It drives out the cold.

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.140
Is that so?

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:16.310
Alright.

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:17.640
We will take a pot then.

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.270
But I drove.

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:21.060
It is fine,

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:22.500
I have a license.

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.020
That is great.

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:25.980
Thank you, boss.

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:26.950
Alright, coming right up.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:31.340
Here are the keys.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.220
Mr. Hu, you teach physics.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.060
You must be very good at driving.

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:37.580
I...

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:39.860
I am not sure.

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:43.340
I only just got my license

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:44.750
and have not even driven
on the road yet.

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:49.450
Then I am really lucky

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:51.220
to be here for your first time.

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:56.660
Well...

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.300
It tastes good.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:01.940
It really does.

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:05.020
Meiqi.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.640
I think Mr. Hu is quite decent.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.140
He is.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.380
He is educated and has a steady job.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.410
What more could you want.

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:13.180
He is just a bit dull.

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:14.940
Interesting or dull is all relative.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:16.700
Yes, your dad is right.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:18.740
Think about your brother as a child.

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:19.740
Stubborn as anything.

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:20.690
Absolutely rigid.

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:23.140
We both thought

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.300
he would struggle to find a girlfriend.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.680
Yet in his second year of uni,

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.380
he managed
to win your sister-in-law over.

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:29.530
Jianqi is stubborn.

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:31.120
Once he decides something,

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.260
nothing will change his mind.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:33.220
But still,

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.300
he is a sweetheart.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.170
Far warmer than Hu Gang.

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.820
Men need a bit of guidance.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.260
You have to teach them, right?

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:43.980
Mr. Hu cares about you so much,

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.740
yet you suddenly stopped talking to him.

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.680
He is probably pining at home right now.

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.040
Unable to eat or sleep.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:50.750
Serves him right.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.100
He is far too slow.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:58.540
Sorry.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.780
I am still not very practiced.

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:02.700
Not at all.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.410
You have a great sense of direction.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.380
If you had not said so,

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:06.920
I would have thought
you had years of experience.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:07.820
Really?

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:15.980
Sorry.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.000
It is fine.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:18.890
Look at how quick your reactions are.

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:20.260
Your speed control is excellent.

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:21.340
You are doing well.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:29.140
I think I am starting to get used to it.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.140
See, I told you.

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.400
You physics people

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.700
always have a gift for driving.

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:36.100
No, not at all.

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:38.060
You encouraged me well.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.260
Mr. Hu, you know what?

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.040
I have always admired

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.260
science students like you.

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:46.910
When it comes to circuits in series

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:47.830
or in parallel,

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.780
I can never make sense of them.

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.180
But you understand them so clearly.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:53.300
Do I?

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.030
If you want to learn,

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:56.300
I can teach you.

00:33:58.500 --> 00:33:59.180
All right.

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:00.700
But

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:02.740
I might be a bit slow.

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.300
What if I never get it?

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.260
Well, that is possible.

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:14.780
Then what should I do?

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.060
I can teach you slowly.

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.460
As long as you try,

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.260
I am sure you will learn it.

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.020
Anyway, if something breaks, you fix it.

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:33.140
What?

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.460
I said I will definitely try my best.

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:39.940
Let us go.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.840
Shall I reach out

00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.740
and invite him over for dinner?

00:34:58.740 --> 00:34:59.940
Give him a way to step back in.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:01.120
No.

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:05.670
If you do not speak to him
and he does not speak to you,

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.460
you will stay stuck like this.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:08.300
I do not mind.

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.370
I do not believe he can hold out.

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:12.680
You do not understand.

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.620
There has to be a rule in these things.

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.260
Whoever gives in first loses.

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:17.380
True.

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:18.540
That is true.

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.080
Fine, then let him stew for a bit.

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:23.300
Let him reflect on himself properly.

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.320
Well,

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:27.300
Mr. Hu is quite a good catch.

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:29.300
He might even have a girlfriend now.

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:30.220
Impossible.

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.840
He has been single
for nearly thirty years.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.450
How could he get one
the moment I step back?

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.180
Exactly, Meiqi is right.

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:38.180
Let me tell you.

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:40.260
Even if he has a girlfriend now,

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:41.880
he is only pretending.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.100
It is just to show Meiqi.

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:46.130
That trick is called
playing hard to get.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.060
Mr. Hu is not that calculating.

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:49.980
I can hear it.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:51.660
Meiqi,

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:52.740
I think

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.120
you still like that Mr. Hu.

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.770
If you like him,
then be brave and go after him.

00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:58.750
Do not keep him waiting.

00:35:59.220 --> 00:35:59.980
I am telling you.

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:01.980
It is just like doing a project.

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.470
Until that final stamp goes down,

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:06.060
everyone still has a chance.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:07.780
You do not understand. Eat your food.

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:08.580
I do not understand?

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.120
How do I not understand?

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.180
Mom, Dad, I am done eating.

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.370
You two take your time.

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:20.370
I am heading back.

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:21.180
- All right.
- You are done.

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:21.740
You are done.

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:22.370
Take your time.

00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:23.210
All right.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:34.780
Hello.

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:36.580
I am sorry.

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.900
I am in the middle of something.

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.140
I will call you later.

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:44.260
This is bad.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.300
Are you cold?

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:58.020
Here, put my coat over your shoulders.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.470
Are you girls always afraid of the cold?

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:12.780
We girls?

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.940
We girls are not all that delicate.

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.100
Here, Mr. Hu, put this on.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:20.500
Do not catch a chill.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.820
You still have not recovered
from your cold.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:23.580
No.

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:25.100
The chicken soup fixed it.

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:26.350
I feel stronger.

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:27.780
Let us go.

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.020
We girls...

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:37.540
What is it?

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:40.540
My bag, the cover slipped inside.

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:42.660
This chicken soup is wonderful.

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.780
I feel warm all over after drinking it.

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:47.020
Yes, right.

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:49.220
I said chicken soup works.

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:49.900
Yes.

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:50.460
It works.

00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:58.780
Dad.

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.500
Where's he going this late?

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:13.220
Mom.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:14.970
I bought some milk
and put it in the fridge.

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.140
Do not forget to drink it.

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:16.860
All right.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:18.340
When I went out just now,

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.420
I saw Dad going out too.

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:21.590
Some clients called him.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.220
They asked him to play mahjong.

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:25.420
It is at the tea house
across the street.

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:25.900
Yes.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.360
(Does he need to drive
for a place that close?)

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.070
Mom, I am heading back.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:32.900
All right, go on.

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:39.020
Jianqi.

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:41.300
Your dad must have lied today.

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:45.660
But why would he lie?

00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:32.100
Listen.

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.580
I think my father-in-law
has been acting strange.

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:35.420
What happened?

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:37.530
Last night he told my mother-in-law,

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:39.340
he was going to the tea house
across the road.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.980
But he drove off somewhere else.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.380
He came home very late.

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:43.740
And he did not go inside.

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:45.350
He just stood at the door smoking.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.780
Whether he is acting strange
or not is none of your business.

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:50.220
Of course it is not.

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:51.340
Then that is settled.

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:56.460
Did you know your dad
had an affair when you were a kid?

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.300
How could I not know?

00:39:58.460 --> 00:39:59.670
My mom made a huge scene.

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:01.490
Even the old lady
selling buns heard about it.

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:03.900
Then how are you so calm about it?

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:06.540
What else can you do?

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:08.660
If it rains, it rains, and if she
wants a divorce, she wants a divorce.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:10.810
Everyone should just manage themselves.

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:12.090
If everyone manages themselves,

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:14.460
the world would be a lovely place.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:16.740
Right, perfect timing.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.500
I found that cow for you.

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:20.900
Strong and well-built.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:21.940
Top of the cattle world.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:25.500
This cow looks quite handsome.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:27.500
Does it poo?

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.380
It does not.

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.820
Good. Send it to the client
and let them confirm.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:32.420
All right.

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:35.800
You have time to worry about
your father-in-law,

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.510
you might as well
care about me a little.

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.180
When you called me yesterday,

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:40.780
I happened to be with Mr Hu.

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:43.600
"I had not eaten anything.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.010
A friend saw how pitiful I looked,

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:46.320
so he treated me to chicken soup."

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:47.620
You are disgusting.

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:51.000
I am in a critical phase
of my project now,

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.320
so stop calling me randomly.

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.100
You throw off my rhythm.

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:54.510
You are someone who forgets friends
the moment you see a man.

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:55.840
You actually talk about rhythm now.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.220
When Mr. Hu bought me
chicken soup yesterday,

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:00.580
I praised him non stop,

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:02.090
saying he was one of a kind,

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:03.060
and no one else compared.

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.140
It was all positive energy.

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:05.460
I am certain of one thing,

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:07.220
even if Hu Gang
cooked himself into a pot,

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:08.950
Feng Meiqi would not
say a single nice word.

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.270
She is still at home right now,

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:12.840
waiting for Hu Gang to come back to her.

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:14.580
How am I supposed to tell her anything?

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:17.500
If you do not know how to say it,
then do not say anything.

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.220
I already have everything under control.

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:20.700
You are that confident?

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:24.500
Listen, Feng Meiqi is like a book
full of wrong answers.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.010
She relies on being rich and pretty,
and she scribbles however she likes.

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:27.660
Luckily,

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.060
I have corrected everything now.

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:30.900
So tell me, what can she do?

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.060
I only have one request.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:35.020
Say it.

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:36.520
Do not tell anyone we know each other.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:38.440
How could we not know each other?

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.490
We do not just know each other,
we are close friends.

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.470
You even showed me
Feng Meiqi's wrong answer book,

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.880
and we went through it page by page.

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:46.660
You might as well push me off a cliff.

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:48.660
Look at the two of them.

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:50.450
Do they not look exactly
like me and Hu Gang?

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.570
You did not need to bring anything
when you came.

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:07.740
Why did you bring gifts?

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:09.380
It is nothing really.

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:11.500
Honestly.

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:12.900
How is your recovery going now?

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.060
It is fine most of the time,

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.580
but it still aches
around the wound sometimes.

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:19.020
You still need to be careful.

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:20.710
I will.

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:26.900
Zhidong is getting married.

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:29.860
And I have fallen sick again.

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:35.260
Money has been very tight lately.

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:37.110
What do you think, brother?

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:39.890
I was wondering if I could

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.710
borrow a little from you.
